Lai, Rifah Abdullah, Gaby Mahrholz, Lisa DeBruine 2020-08-31 About Experimentum Getting Support For Experimentum @ University of Glasgow Users Currently there are two active admins available to provide support, these are Rebecca Lai and Professor Lisa DeBruine. Admins play a double role. In addition to helping you with Experimentum we are active researchers and teaching staff with additional jobs to do elsewhere. Our inboxes are often full, and emails will often go unread. As a result of this, all students and staff who are experiencing technical issues should use the Slack workspace “Experimentum-web” to get support. Additionally, we are using the queries on the slack workspace to best update the user documentation, so it is important to keep all correspondence in one neat location. You should never post data on this workspace, either in data file or screenshot form, as this would be a violation of the GDPR. All such files will be removed and your supervisor will be informed. If you need to share your data please use one of the university approved services available to you, such as OneDrive or OwnCloud. Lost Passwords You can now reset your password without having to consult a system admin. You can do this by going to the login page, supplying your user ID or email address in the “Username” box and pressing the “Reset Password” button, as shown below: If you have reset your password you will be supplied with a randomly generated one to your registered email address. You should change this as soon as possible, if not immediately. If you do not have access to the registered email inbox please speak to your supervisor or the admins who may be able to reset your password for you on production of valid ID. Changing Your Password You can change your password by signing in, navigating to “My Account” from the menu on the right of the page and clicking the link “change your password” under “Username”: Tutorial Sessions During times of particularly heavy use through the academic year we may schedule specific help sessions to deal with common issues and to help you fix specific problems that you might have. These will be advertised on the Slack workspace and on appropriate Moodle pages. If you are experiencing an issue that is particularly difficult to fix remotely, you can make an appointment with Rebecca via private message on the “Experimentum-web” workspace. However, you should have made attempts to solve the issue remotely first as time available for these appointments is extremely limited. If you require assistance to navigate this document or create your study due to disability please contact your supervisor who may refer you to the admins. For Other Users @ Other Institutions If you download and use the code for this platform you should establish clear guidelines outlining the role of the admins and methods of support in accordance with any relevant regulations. Staff from the University of Glasgow will not provide support for users of other systems based upon this code. Our Slack workspace is for internal use only. Experimentum is an evolving platform. If you find an issue with the Experimentum codebase, you can file an issue here. If you find an issue with the codebase for this manual, including missing or unclear information, you can file an issue here. Privacy Notices Cookies Cookies are used for Experimentum to allow us to track user sessions, which allows participants to navigate between pages during a session without having to log in to every page. In the case of anonymous logins, the session is tracked to maintain the same identity across multiple elements of the same study. Cookies are not tracked beyond a single session, for either registered or anonymous participants. By closing the browser the current session is ended and cookies tracking the session are discarded. Cookies are not used in any other way by us, and the information is not retained or shared with any other organisations. Data Management For Participants The University of Glasgow guidelines with regard to data protection are available to view here and more general data management guidelines here. Researchers must adhere to these when collecting, processing, storing and using your data. If you have any questions about your data your first point of contact should be the researcher who collected it. Contact details will be given in the studies you take part in. Researchers are ethically and legally obligated to answer your questions about your data. About your data With all account types, besides anonymous participation, your user ID is linked to the data that you submit. This allows us to track users in multi-part studies, but it also means that our servers will contain multiple bits of information about you built up through your participation. Individual researchers will only be able to access the data that you submit on their studies, and not data you submit to studies belonging to other researchers. In real terms, this means that individual researchers will only see the data that you give to them, not the data that you give across the entire site. In cases where you participate in multiple studies for the same researcher, they will be able to see your data across these studies. Individual researchers are responsible for the protection of your privacy, ensuring that there is no way for any third party to use this information to “triangulate” your identity using the information you have provided. If you have any concerns about how your data is used please contact the researchers involved in the study or studies that you are taking/have taken part in. To see the University’s guidelines on how researchers should treat data see here. You have rights concerning your own data and how it is used, and responsible researchers should always hold these in the highest regard. If you have any concerns about how your data is being used you should contact the researcher in question in the first instance. If you are reluctant to speak to them directly you can speak to their supervisor, whose contact information should be given to you at the time of undertaking the study or upon request from the researcher. Alternatively, you can contact the Data Protection and Freedom of Information Office here. For Researchers Your study’s data is your responsibility. Please ensure that it is protected and used appropriately. The University of Glasgow guidelines with regard to data protection are available to view here and more general data management guidelines here. Experimentum saves your data to the University of Glasgow School of Psychology secure servers, which are on-site within the department. Data will be output in Comma Separated Value (.csv) files in “tidy” format and is available for download from by the researcher(s) who own the study, their supervisors and admins only. Whilst data processing questions should be directed to the researcher (or your supervisor(s) and advisors if you are a student/researcher), there are a couple of common tasks that you might find yourself needing to do. See the examples in the section Commonly used R code for help with some common code segments. Consent Upon registration, users are asked to complete a standardised consent form: When constructing studies, you should also include your own consent form, including all relevant information specified by your supervisor(s) and regulatory body relevant to your work. Consent forms usually take the form of an additional mixed questionnaire component presented at the start of your study. Citing Experimentum Currently we recommend that you cite either the website (https://exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/), the codebase on GitHub (https://github.com/debruine/experimentum) or this manual, following the appropriate citation format for your discipline.

["quick-reference-guide.html", "Chapter 1 Quick Reference Guide 1.1 Most Common Issues 1.2 Questionnaire Component Types 1.3 Experiment Component Types 1.4 Structuring Your Study 1.5 Testing Your Study 1.6 Activating Projects 1.7 Favourites/Pinned Items", " Chapter 1 Quick Reference Guide This page is intended to be a quick reference guide and not a subsitute for reading the appropriate sections of the manual relevant to your needs. 1.1 Most Common Issues For a list of the currently known bugs and workarounds see the section containing known issues and most frequently asked questions. 1.2 Questionnaire Component Types For more detailed information on the types of questionnaire components and the questions within see the section on mixed questionnaires in the questionnaire component types section. Questionnaire Type Response Type DV Mixed Questionnaire Multiple types of questions can be combined in a single component. Variable by question type. See each questionnaire type for more information. Radiopage Multiple questions asked across a single radio button response scale Numeric value which is not seen by participants that corresponds to text labels which are seen by participants. Can incorporate automatic reverse-scoring. Rank Order A list of options which are dragged into relative rank order by participants. Rank position assigned by participants of the various items. 1.3 Experiment Component Types For more detailed information on the types of experimental components please see the full section on experimental component types. Experiment Type Response Type DV 2AFC Alternative forced-choice with 2 options. Binary, defaulted to 0 or 1 assigned depending on how you assign the stimuli to trials. 2-AFC with 8 button strength of choice Alternative forced-choice between two stimuli, but with the addition of strength of preference for the choice made on an 8-point scale. Out of 8, with 0-3 indicating strength of choice in one direction for one piece of stimuli and 4-7 indicating strength of choice in the other direction for the other piece of stimuli. Labelled Buttons Display 1, 2 or 3 stimuli items and participants respond on a scale set by the researcher. Akin to a Likert scale. A numerical value corresponding to the values set by the researcher. Slider A sliding scale between two numerical points where the number is not displayed to participants. Numerical, between upper and lower bounds and at increments set by the researcher. X-AFC Alternative forced-choice with more than 2 options. Participants pick only one. DV is a number which corresponds to the column the chosen stimuli item is assigned to on the stimuli assignment page, ranging from 1 to X. Sorting Participants put stimuli in order of some specified preference by dragging them into position on the screen Number of times participants changed the order and the order the stimuli was placed in. Also provides stimuli original order of presentation. Slideshow Timed display of stimuli items where participants are only asked to watch, with no data collected or rendered. Usually used as a precursor to another component. None. 1.4 Structuring Your Study Sets and projects are used for structuring and delivering your project. 1.4.1 Sets Sets create the internal stucture of your study using a combination of grouping of questionnaire and experimental components and decision rules which move participants between them. For more information see the sets section of this site. 1.4.2 Projects Projects are the final “container” for the supersets, sets and individual components that you have made. This allows for the study to be presented to the participants. Here, you will assign a URL suffix that will allow your participants to access the study. Projects do not allow for the automatic filtering of participants, as server-side calculations are not possible, however they may allow for simple branching based on participants self-selection into sets within the project. For more information see the projects section of the site. 1.5 Testing Your Study You must test your study before you ask your supervisor to make it live. For more information please see the section with recommendations on how to test your study and the student checklist before you ask your supervisor to activate your study. 1.6 Activating Projects For students, contact your supervisor to have your project activated. Autonomous researchers and PGR students can activate their own projects. Instructions for activating projects can be found in the section for supervisors. Once a study is activated it cannot be edited without resetting it back to “test” status, essentially deactivating it. Students should confirm that they are completely happy with the study before they ask you to activate it. This is why the student checklist has been provided to them. When you attempt to edit an active item this warning is displayed at the top of the page next to the “Save” button: If you make a change to the study after activation, rendering it inactive, the supervisor remains the point of contact to reactivate it. You may wish to check that the edits made have not impacted the validity or quality of the project, or how comparable data before and after the changes are. 1.7 Favourites/Pinned Items You can add frequently used items to your favourite’s menu to help you find them more quickly. This is done by navigating to the appropriate section of the page depending on what item you want to add to your favourites. Find the item that you want to add to your favourites and click on the circle next to it under the column header “Favs”: The next time that you go to the researcher’s page you will see a menu on the left-hand side of the page called “My Pinned Items” that contains the items you have labelled as favs: "],
["accounts.html", "Chapter 2 User Accounts 2.1 Overview 2.2 Account Types 2.3 Registration Process 2.4 Requesting Researcher Status 2.5 Checking your account status 2.6 Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests", " Chapter 2 User Accounts 2.1 Overview There are several account types that you can have with Experimentum, each with its own purpose and different levels of privileges. This chapter explains what account types exist, what they do, which type of account you might want to have and how to change account types for supervisors. 2.2 Account Types The following types of account are displayed in the downloaded data. Here is a brief explanation of the types of accounts and important informations about them. 2.2.1 “Guest” Accounts For participants who are not required to have an account. You do not need to be signed in but you can still take part in some experiments on the site. When you close your browser, this account is discarded and no longer tracked. Essentially a disposable burner account, this allows for anonymous participation. If a guest participant closes their browser mid-way through a study their progress will not be saved and the data will read as an incomplete run. As guest users do not have a profile, we do not store their age, gender or any other types of information about them. We suggest that you do not place age or gender restrictions on studies without strong theoretical or ethical reasons to do so, especially where participants take part anonymously as guests. When guests sign into a study they will see a dialogue box asking them for their age and gender to “replace” where stored account information usually provides it. This information is used to prevent those who should not take part from taking part and inserted into the user information in the downloaded data files. If you need to collect further demographic information, we suggest constructing a demographics questionnaire component. There is a known issue with the gathering of participant ages which has only been observed and reported through guest type logins, see known issues for more information. To prevent irritrevable data loss should you experience this bug, it is recommended that you do not rely on this method to gather age and gender identity alone. Including a secondary age question in your demographics should give you a backup should you need it. 2.2.2 “Registered” Accounts These accounts are for participants. You have created an account and given us your date of birth and gender identification. You can participate in studies on the site. Your participation record is tracked, meaning that you can be linked across multiple-part studies should you give permission for this to be done. Under no circumstances should you be linked across multiple studies without your explicit permission, we will never use data to “triangulate” your identity. Researchers can only access your data from their own studies, not the studies of other researchers. 2.2.3 “Student” Accounts For students who are conducting research as part of a 3rd year quantitative project, undergraduate dissertation, master’s or doctoral thesis. To create and run studies you must first register and then request researcher status. Your supervisor will be the person who changes your account status and you can check the status of your account by looking at your account info. When approved, students will be given “student” status, a special type of research account. You may still use this account to participate in experiments, but we advise setting up a separate registered, non-research account for participation to prevent serious data submissions from being removed by other investigators. 2.2.4 “Researcher” Accounts For staff and more senior students using Experimentum. Researcher accounts no longer appear in the list of potential supervisors for students. If you have supervision duties, choose a “supervisor” account instead. Follow the instructions for students as above, but these users should set either Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as their supervisor, who will grant them “researcher” status. PGRs should have their supervisor confirm their autonomy with the admins before requesting this through the system to allow for speedy processing of your request. This “supervision” is a formality to allow admins access to your account for support purposes, and not supervision in the traditional sense- for this type of support you should consult your own supervisor. Supervisors who want their more senior students to have their own “researcher” account will have to confirm this directly with the admins. Such requests from students on behalf of their supervisor or third party will not be granted. 2.2.5 “Supervisor” Accounts If you plan on supervising students using Experimentum you should set up a supervisor account to be able to oversee the construction of their studies, share components and change studies to “active” before data collection can begin. When you have established your supervisor account your name will appear in the list of potential supervisors for students to choose from. Supervisors should have a supervisor account if they intend for their students to use this system. If supervisors do not engage with the system then their students will not be able to use it. Supervision duties in this system should not be passed to another member of staff so that you can avoid registering. Admins will not cover the duties of the supervisor. See the Supervisor Cheatsheet for a breakdown of the roles of the admins and the supervisors. 2.2.6 “Test” Accounts For students and staff. This account type gives you the same amount of privileges as the registered account for participants, but any data collected from these accounts is saved in data sets with a status of “test”. This allows you and other test accounts to try out your study and easily identify and filter out which data should be excluded from the analysis. If you wish to have a test account contact an admin to set this up. Where students have erroneously registered multiple times, duplicate accounts will often be changed to “test” status. 2.2.7 “Admin” Accounts For Experimentum support staff. This is the highest level of access. An admin account basically allows us to “supervise” all users, including researcher accounts. We use this to see what is happening when problems arise to help provide aid, not to take responsibility for approval of status changes of students or oversee the design or activation of studies. This “supervision” is a formality to allow admins access to your account for support purposes, and not supervision in the traditional sense- for this type of support you should consult your own supervisor. 2.3 Registration Process In order to sign up to the site you will select “Sign up” on the top right-hand side of the page. Once there you will be taken to a new page as below and asked to create a username, set a password and confirm it, provide your gender identity and birthday. Completing these steps alone will create a “registered” account type. With this account type you can participate in studies on the site. Your participation record is tracked, meaning that you can be linked across multiple-part studies. Under no circumstances will you be linked across multiple studies without your explicit permission and we will never use data to “triangulate” your identity. Researchers and students can only access your data from their own studies, not the studies of others. 2.4 Requesting Researcher Status If you are a researcher or a student who is using the site to conduct a research project (such as a mini or maxi project, or an MSc or PhD thesis) you will need to request permission to construct and conduct studies. If you are a supervising member of teaching staff, you will also need to have an account in order to supervise your students project. On the registration page, or the account page if you have already registered, there is a “Request Researcher Status” button. When you click on this additional fields will appear that you will need to fill in, as below. You will need to provide us with your name, your email address and your supervisor. You should use your university email address to sign up and provide your real name so that your supervisor can more easily identify you. If you are a student conducting a research project you should select the member of staff supervising your project from the drop-down menu of supervisors. If you are a supervising member of teaching or research staff, you should request Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as your supervisor. If you are a more senior student who is relatively self-sufficient or you have supervising duties of your own, and your supervisor agrees to it, you can also request Lisa or Rebecca as your supervisor, and we will set you as a “researcher” account type. As a general rule, all students completing a research project should be assigned “student” status. Some PhD students may be better off with “researcher” or “supervisor” accounts (if they assist in supervising more junior students). Such individuals should speak to their supervisors and the admins to determine which is the best account type for them. Supervisors who want their more senior students to have their own “researcher” account will have to confirm this directly with the admins. Such requests from students on behalf of their supervisor or third party will not be granted. 2.5 Checking your account status When you first sign up your account will be the “registered” type and will remain as such until your researcher status is approved. You can check on the status of your account by selecting “account” from the menu on the right-hand side of the page. Underneath the “My Information” section of the page will tell you your date of registration, number of logins and current account type. The menu on the right also changes when you have been granted researcher status, with a new option of “Researchers” available which takes you to the study creation area of the site. If there is a delay in accepting your request you should contact your supervisor directly and not the admin staff. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to make changes to your access level. If your supervisor is experiencing technical difficulties in accepting your request, they should contact the admins directly themselves. Admins will not respond to a student who is requesting help on behalf of their supervisor. 2.6 Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure that their students have the status that they require to carry out their projects. This includes assigning them sufficient permissions to construct and deploy their studies. If you are a supervisor and unsure as to what type of account to give a student, refer to the account types section above. Once the supervisor has “supervisor” status they will have a new area of the website opened to them, accessible through the researchers’ link in the menu on the right, which will contain a section called “Admin”: Clicking on this button will take them to a page with more options. To see and make changes to the privileges of those who have requested you as a supervisor and requested researcher status select the option “Supervision” from the menu. Here you will see a list of individuals who have requested you as a supervisor. To change their status, select the appropriate account type from the right-most drop-down menu under the column “Status”. The account you are making changes to will have to log out and back in again to be updated with their new permissions. When you press “Send” an email will be sent to the student to inform them of the status change. There is a known issue with changing the statuses of research accounts regarding accounts not being found by the system, see here "],
["stimuli.html", "Chapter 3 Stimuli 3.1 Overview 3.2 Accepted File Formats 3.3 Naming Conventions 3.4 Pre-Processing 3.5 Uploading Stimuli 3.6 Using Stimuli", " Chapter 3 Stimuli Things to add: Creating image stimuli will need to have it’s own section, this can incorporate individual image conversion and resizing via GIMP 3.1 Overview This chapter will cover how to upload your own stimuli, tips on naming conventions for the easiest possible way to assign stimuli to trials, accepted file formats and a rough guide to how to convert to the required formats. Remember that not all image, video and audio files are free for use. Check the license and terms of use of the images before you save, edit or copy and paste them. 3.2 Accepted File Formats Experimentum uses what we hope to be the most universally applicable file formats to deliver your study. These are the file formats that can be successfully displayed through the site. Please ensure that you conform to these types as others may not be tolerated by the system. Stimuli Type Accepted Formats Images JPEG, GIF and PNG Audio MP3 Video M4V 3.3 Naming Conventions In order to make the process of assigning stimuli to trials as easy as possible it is recommended that you establish a systematic way of assigning names to files. The stage of assigning stimuli to trials goes much faster and smoother if you can search for the stimuli files names using some sort of common text string in the names of the files. For example, here I have 24 stimuli items. These are stylized face images of both mal and female gender (Mooney 1957). I have named them using the convention “mooneyxn.jpg”, where x is either m or f (for male and female) and n for the number of the pair that I will present them in: This systematic naming helps in searching for your stimuli later when you come to assign them to trials. Here I can use the search box to find all stimuli containing the string “mooneyf”. I can then assign them to one of two images displayed in each trial of this two alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiment below: I can also search for “mooneym” and repeat the process for the other image for the male faces. It is also beneficial to store their names in an Excel spreadsheet. Here I have stored them in pairs under column headers. I can use this later when assigning them to trials. I have also assigned trial names; this will come in handy should I need to know which trial each data point refers to in my analysis. This example above is where each male face will be compared to a corresponding female face in a trial with two images. You may have more or less than two stimuli items per trial and your spreadsheet should vary accordingly. 3.4 Pre-Processing In order to get your stimuli up with the minimal amount of fuss, please ensure that you do any required pre-processing. 3.4.1 Images Images should be of uniform size and of the correct file formats before uploading. The following information is but one way that you can amend your files to the correct format and resolution for the site. There may be other ways to achieve the same goal. The method you choose it up to you, this is provided for those who may need some help. If you do not resize your stimuli to the appropriate size you might find inconsistencies in the presentation of your stimuli that could act as a confounding factor in your experiments: Creating Images You may be required to make your own image stimuli, either a modification of previously used stimuli or something completely new. This section talks about some of the basic functions of GNU Image Manipulation Program (“GIMP”, The GIMP Development Team 2019), but cannot give an in depth tutorial. There are many available online as this software is fairly well used. GIMP is a free software that allows you to create images from scratch and modify and export export existing image files to a variety of file formats. This software was developed as a free and open source equivalent to photo-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and can achieve very complex tasks. Exporting images from .xcf to Experimentum compatible formats is covered in the exporting images section below- the process is the same. New Image To create a new image, select File &gt; New...: A dialogue box will appear allowing you to set the size of the new image you are going to create. As shown, you can alter the size in many different units of measurement: Once you have set and accepted these parameters you will be presented with your new, blank image: If you are presented with a grey checker pattern instead of a white background as presented here, then the background is transparent instead of white. When exporting images in some formats, like PNG, this transparency will be preserved in areas that you have not placed text or images. GIMP File Format The file extension of files created in GIMP will be .xcf. These types of files allow for saving of image layers and text path information, allowing you to have an image made of multiple layers and with text that can be edited at a later point. Here is an example of a .xcf file that I used to export multiple .png files from when creating the section on layers below. It uses multiple layers on the same graphic to circle the relevant discussion points, creating a standardised output. Layers with circles were duplicated and placed over the various buttons and made invisible when they were not required. Saving images with layers and text path information could come in handy if you are generating your own image stimuli which features small changes (such as different words), but remains mostly the same (same background colour, size, fonts, etc). In this case you could save a layer or export a different .GIF, .JPG or .PNG from the same .XCF file for each change that you need to make. Layers Layers allow you to create multiple layers of an image stacked on top of each other. This can be particularly handy when creating many images which need to be of a matching standard, such as text or images which differ vary slightly in a controlled way. Layers at the top of the stack will be “on top” of the others, with their content obscuring the parts below them if the ones on top are visible. You can move layers around in the stack, or toggle the visibility of layers to change what (and how) the image looks. You can then “export” the visible parts of images to create image stimuli. The layout of your interface may differ, but there should be either a free floating dialogue box or “docked” dialogue open called “layers” or with a symbol of stacked layers as appears here: You start with one layer, called “background”. To make changes to a layer you must have that layer selected. Select layers by clicking on them. They should become highlighted. Layer Tools There are a number of useful layer tools in the layer box. Here is a short explanation of some of the more useful ones. This button will create a new layer. The new layer will appear “on top” of the layers you already have: This button will duplicate a layer that you already have. It will duplicate the current layer you have selected or are editing: These buttons move the layers up and down, dictating which layers obscure which. Alternatively you can click the layer you want to move and drag it up and down the layers in the box: To toggle the visibility of a layer click on the eye symbol next to the layer name. When the eye is visible, so is the layer: If you want to get rid of a layer, select the layer in the layers box and press this button: Basic Gimp Tools GIMP keeps crashing on me when I try to use the text tool. I’ll need to access another computer to create this image. Converting Pre-Existing Images However, there are only 3 basic operations that you should be able to perform in GIMP order to convert your images to the correct formats. More complex operations are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but there are plenty of resources online should you choose to want to look them up. If there are any further instructions that would prove helpful please file an issue here describing what you want me to include in future versions of the manual. Importing Images There are a number of ways that you can import images into GIMP. File &gt; Open This is the simplest way to open an image file in GIMP. Open the software first from your Start Menu or Launchpad. Then click on File &gt; Open...: A dialogue box will appear from which you can navigate to the location of the file you are attempting to open and select it. Click Open and the file will open. “Open With” If you already have the image file saved on your PC, you can navigate to the file’s location through your file explorer or finder and right click on it. Select “Open With” in the menu that pops up. This will open the GIMP GUI and should open a new tab with that image inside it. On some machines GIMP will not be automatically recognised as a type of software associated with image files. In this case you will need to select “Choose another app” and navigate to the executable file for GIMP (location may vary depending on machine and operating system type). It is not advisable to permanently change all image files to be associated with GIMP, as the software can run slowly and sometimes you only want to view an image in a photo browser, not edit it. Edit &gt; Paste as… &gt; New Image Finally, if the image file is not saved on your computer you can copy it to the clipboard and paste it directly into GIMP. Do this by going to Edit &gt; Paste as... &gt; New Image. This will create a new image in GIMP that is not yet saved. I recommend saving immediately in the first instance and periodically thereafter. These will be in the GIMP file format, .xcf. Changing Image Size Images that are too large can be resized in the &lt;img&gt; html tag to fit into a smaller space but if your image is too large you could be using more memory than would be required to store your images on the server. This may have a knock on effect in the stimuli loading times. Rather than consume excess bandwidth it is adviable to size the images down prior to uploading them on to the server. To resize the image (and all layers and items contained within) click on the menu Image and press “Scale Image…”. This dialoue box will come up: The image size defaults to px, or pixels. The height and the weight are by default linked together (as demonstrated by the chain symbol to the right of the two boxes). When linked changing either the height or the width will keep the image to the same aspect ratio (the proportions of the sizes). You may unlink the aspect ratio by clicking on the chain. When unlinked the chain will appear as broken. Linking these helps you avoid distortion that might happen if you resize one dimension only, which might elongate/shorten the other dimension and make it look funny. It also allows you to make images to fit in a specific space in your study. For example, this word completion task where images are used instead of text: I have used images in the question field of a mixed questionnaire, as the blank spaces are more apparent to the participants. I have also limited their size to 25px to ensure that they do not seem too oversized in comparison to the text entry fields next to them. Exporting Images GIMP is capable of exporting GIF, JPEG and PNG file formats. To export your image go to File &gt; Export As. You will then be asked to enter a file name in the text box at the top of the dialogue box that opens up. You can specify the type of file by typing the file extension at the end of the file name, “.gif”, “.jpg” or “.png” for each of the aforementioned file types respectively. Once you have done this, press the “export” button at the bottom of the dialogue box. You may be asked to specify compression options after pressing the button. This is just to ask how much (if any) quality you are willing to sacrifice to save on the size of the file. This is an example from a PNG file. This image was compressed with the default options. As you can tell the quality is good, but the image is not very rich. A richer image with higher levels of variation in the pixels may do worse that this one with the same level of compression. When exporting JPEG files you will be asked to select the quality as a percentage, not compression level. The higher the percentage the higher the quality and the less compression being done. Experiment with the levels of comrpression in the image and examine the outputs carefully for any artifacts in the images resulting from the compression process. If you find the quality lacking, lower the amount of compression allowed and try again until you find the level appropriate for your images. These images are saved as JPEG, and are at 100%, 50% and 0% quality. This gives file sizes of 76KB, 9KB and 2KB respectively: The first is 100% quality, no compression or compression artefacts. The second is 50% quality and has minimal pixelation artifacts around the periphery of the face, neck, hair and some issues with the skin texture in places. It also seems (to my office mates and I at least) that the skin tone is a little yellower in image 2, likely a result of a reduction in the available colour palette. The third image (0% quality) is unusable for the vast majority of purposes. The level of compression that you choose will be a compromise between what the system can successfully deliver, loading times and what the level of compression does to the images that you are using. Batch Procesing Images If you have pre-existing stimuli that need to be resized or converted to another format you may want to use IrfanView (Skiljan, Irfan (2019)). IrfanView is a fast, compact image viewer and editor for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10 available in 32 and 64 bit versions. Batch Conversion You can resize and convert images at the same time by setting the appropriate options in one process. If you need to convert images to JPG, GIF or PNG in bulk, you can do this easily. First, ensure that all of your files are in the same folder. Open IrfanView and go to “File” &gt; “Batch Conversion/Rename”: This will open the Batch conversion dialogue: In the top left, ensure that batch conversion and the intended output format are selected: In the top centre, use the “Look in:” part of the window to naviagte to the folder in which the images to be converted are stored. Highlight the images to be converted and press “Add”, or if you are converting all the files in the folder, press “Add all”: The bottom box showing “Input files” should now be populated with your files. Check that the count (shown in brackets) corresponds to the number of items that you expect: To the left of this select the output folder. This is where the converted image files will be placed. It is best to create a new folder to keep the types of image separate: This is the file browser dialogue that you will see. Find the folder you want to store the converted files in and press “OK”: Click “Start Batch” to begin the conversion process: You will be shown a dialogue box showing the processing. Once conversion is complete you will be shown a one line summary. you can now press “Exit batch” if you are finished: Double check that your output files are correct after you have run the batch processing by navigating to them using your file system browser. Batch Resize You can resize and convert images at the same time by setting the appropriate options in one process. If your images are the wrong size you can also resize the images in bulk too. Select the input files and output folder as explained above in the previous section .Access the “Bulk Conversion/Rename” dialogue again from the file menu: In the dialogue, select “Use advanced options (for bulk resize)” and then press the “Advanced” button: Use the “Resize” section to set a new size: Here I have reduced my images from 1024*1024 pixels to 400*400 pixels (as the dimensions match on each side). Press OK to return to the previous dialogue where, if you have set the other options as indicated above, you can press the “Start Batch” button: You will get the processing dialogue showing the processing and the completion message should it all go well: You can use the other options to achieve other goals, but this is the simplest way to resize images. 3.4.2 Audio Since Experimentum requires auditory stimuli to be uploaded as .mp3 files, here is an easy way to convert audio files (like .wav) to mp3s using Audacity’s batch-processing feature. Audacity is free and open source cross-platform software which can be used to record (with suitable microphone), import, edit and export audio files in many different formats. This is also software that both the Voice Perception Lab and Face Research Lab use in their research. Here you will find the minimal instructions that will allow you to convert your audio files to .mp3 format in Audacity 2.1.2 (Audacity Team 2016) and Audacity 2.3.0 (Audacity Team 2018). For the full user guide see here. Audacity 2.1.2 If you are still on an older version of audacity, go to File &gt; Edit Chains There is already a chain set up for mp3 conversion, which contains 3 steps: Normalising, exporting as mp3, and an END process. Normalisation is a process by which you standardise the aplitude of the audio signal. If you have recorded your own stimuli you will need to normalise it first to ensure that no audio clips are excessively loud or quiet in comparison to the others. If you are using stimuli sourced from elsewhere it may already be normalised. In this case, highlight the first step of the chain and press delete. All you should have in the chain “MP3 Conversion” is 1. ExportMP3, and 2. -END-. Click “OK” to save the chain. Now, go to File &gt; Apply Chain… … select MP3 Conversion, and confirm with “Apply to Files…” Locate the files you want to convert into mp3s from the folder on your computer, select all, and confirm with “Open”. The selected files will then be converted into mp3s. You will find an additional folder called “cleaned” within the folder your original files are located in. Content of the folder “cleaned”: Audacity 2.3.0 Audacity version 2.3.0 changed the batch-processing process, relabelling chains as “Macros”. The menu for accessing the Macros got relocated to Tools &gt; Macros… The following steps are fairly similar to older versions of audacity. Within the macros you will find one already labelled “MP3 Conversion”. In the window “Edit Steps”, select the normalise step (Num 01) and delete it if you have already normalised the amplitude of the stimuli you are using. Make sure you have only the steps “ExportMP3” and “-END-” left in your macro; then click on “Files…” Locate the files you want to convert to mp3s on your computer, select/ highlight all of them, and confirm with “Open”. There might be a warning message popping up asking you for an input method. Select the safer or faster option according to your personality, and confirm with “OK”. Once the process is done, you can find the converted mp3s in a separate folder called “cleaned” that is located within the folder of your original files. Content of the folder “cleaned”: 3.4.3 Video Experimentum required video stimuli to be uploaded in .m4v format. Here is a short tutorial based upon Reed (2016) These are similar to the files with .mp4 extensions – the main difference is that .m4v files are Digital Rights Management (DRM) copyright protected and are mostly used by Apple. If you have a Windows laptop, you can manually change .mp4 video files to .m4v ones without downloading additional software sometimes. This process will only work when the videos are not already copyrighted. Remember that not all files are free to use! This could mean that any file you attempt to convert that has copyright protection will not run again on your computer’s standard video viewer so be sure to make copies if you have permission to use it in case the conversion fails. First go to the file where you have placed your videos. If not already showing, make sure you change the settings so that you can see the file extension. To include the file extension in the name, click on View &gt; File name extensions and check the box or Options &gt; Change folder and search options &gt; View &gt; Advanced settings and uncheck Hide extensions for known file types. You will see that it now says “videoname”.mp4 You can change this by simply renaming the file to “videoname”.m4v and clicking “Yes”, This should make it compatible with the Experimentum website however it may not work if the file is copyright protected. This should not be an issue if you are creating your own custom video stimuli. The presentation of video stimuli is designed for short snippets, rather than longer clips. For optimal performance keep your file sizes in the 2-3Mb range. If you require longer videos you may need to host the content externally (such as on YouTube) and use HTML to embed it into a questionnaire component. 3.5 Uploading Stimuli Prior to uploading your stimuli, ensure that it has been pre-processed to the standard that you expect as the system will not perform automatic transformations on it for you. For example, you should ensure that images are the correct size for presentation, audio segments should have normalised volume, the files in accepted formats etc. You should also establish a naming convention that allows you to easily search for and assign stimuli to trials. This is covered more under “Naming Conventions” above. To upload your stimuli, navigate to the researcher’s area of the site and select the “Stimuli” button from the menu: Select “Upload” from the menu: The following page is split into two sections. The upper section gives you the option to upload stimuli and the bottom section shows you what stimuli you already have uploaded. In the folder name field, enter the names of the folder you want to create. If you wish to create a subfolder type the folder name, a forward slash, then the subfolder name (folder_name/subfolder_name). Click on the browse button and navigate to the folder where your stimuli are stored on your own storage device and select all the files you wish to upload. Click on the “open” button on the dialogue box. Once you have clicked this the file names will appear in the upload section of the page. Check that these are the files that you wish to upload. Enter a description in the description box. This will help you, your supervisors and the admins should you ever require assistance. Click on “Upload” to upload your files. Once you have done this the bottom of the page will change to show the name of the new folder. Clicking on the name of the new folder will open the folder and show you the files within. Clicking a file name will display the file path at the bottom right of the page: Now that you have your stimuli uploaded you can put them into your experiment(s). These steps apply to all types of stimuli that can be uploaded to the site. 3.6 Using Stimuli 3.6.1 Using Stimuli Items In Questionnaires, Set and Component Introductions You may use stimuli items uploaded to the server in questionnaire introduction sections and individual question fields by using either Markdown or HTML syntax. # The HTML code &lt;img src=&quot;image file path goes here with extension&quot;&gt; # The Markdown code ![](image file path goes here with file extension) The image file path can be found by navigating to Researchers &gt; Stimuli &gt; Uploads, selecting the folder name you gave it when you uploaded it and then the image: The image file path is on the right hand side of the page above where the image is displayed. For additional information on using HTML code please see this tutorial on W3Schools. 3.6.2 Assigning Stimuli to Experimental Trials Assigning stimuli to trials is a fundamental part of the process of constructing experimental components so this is covered in the section regarding experimental components here. 3.6.3 Using Stimuli in Questionnaires You can link to stimuli in your questionnaires too. Please read the section in the questionnaires about using stimuli in conjuction with your questionnaires. References "],

Your supervisor needs to have an Experimentum account in order to supervise what you are doing, but some will also have used the system before for their own research. You may wish to create your account and request the appropriate account status before you are ready to start making your study. This will allow you to examine the capabilities of the system and assess if it meets your needs in good time. Assisting you with the design of your study is the job of your supervisor, since you will be working within their area of expertise and they will know more about what you are aiming for than the admins will. When you have settled on a satisfactory design you can planning the implementation of your study and start making it. 4.2 Planning Your Project Studies are made up of a series of individual components (questionnaires or experiments), which are placed into sets to help organise the order of presentation. Sets can also be placed into other sets (also known as “supersets”) to further organise presentation. Studies with rather complex structures can be made by nesting components within sets and sets within supersets, with various ordering options available to you. When the study is constructed it must be placed into a project to allow for presentation to participants. Projects will require you to set a custom and unique URL on the project page. When you disseminate your study, you can add certain options to the URL to allow it to be presented to participants to complete the study anonymously. See the section on Projects for more information on how this works. 4.3 Age/Gender Limitations In most cases you should not set gender or age limitations, especially in cases where you are using anonymous participation. However, if you have a strong ethical or design decision to do so you can set these limitations, such as when you are using graphic images or strong language or have different components for males, females or non-binary participants. You do this in the component or set information section in the “Limited to” box: If you set these limitations and participants refuse age or gender information then participants will not be allowed to progress through your study. If this information is not vital to your research this may result in loss of data that you might have otherwise been able to collect. 4.4 Stimuli First I need to establish what stimuli I am going to be using. Am I going to create my own stimuli? Am I going to use a pre-exisiting set of stimuli items? What formats are they available in, or do I need to convert them? Do I have access to and permission to use them? Check out the stimuli page for discussions on the required file formats and how to convert them. How are these items typically used? This will inform the types of components that you may want to consider using. 4.5 Individual Components I personally find it easiest to plan “inside-out”, as it’s easier for me to think about what components can do in terms of the needs of my design. You should discuss with your supervisor wthe design of your project and what participants are going to have to do in the study you are going to be running. Once you have figured this out with them you should consult the questionnaire page to see which types of questionnaire component you will need to use, and/or which type of experimental components you will need to use. You should familiarise yourself with the capabilities and limitations of the system and the components to assess if it is the right thing for you to be using. Examine the requirements of each of the components that you may need to use and how you would fill them. Look at the types of data outputs that they create and consider how you might analyse the data. Are components available suitable for your requirements? Let’s say I am running a study where participants judge pairs of voice samples. They are going to either make a yes/no decision on whether the pairs of speakers are genetically related or judge the similarity of the voices of the speakers on an 11-point scale. Participants will only see one condition. I will also need to collect demographics information and consent for my participants. As a minimum I will need: One mixed questionnaire for demographics/consent. One labelled buttons experiment for yes/no decisions (2 buttons). One labelled buttons experiment for 0-10 similarity ratings (11 buttons). 4.6 Sets and Supersets Next you need to be thinking about how to place these components into sets and supersets in order to achieve the desired flow of participants through your study. I want participants to either give me a yes/no relatedness judgement or a 0-10 similarity judgement on pairs of speakers. This means that I will want to group these two components together into one set and set the “type” rule to “one of (random)”: I also want all participants to complete my demographics questionnaire. This means I will need to have a superset which encompasses the set I created above and the demographics questionnaire, where items are presented in a fixed order so that the demographics questionnaire comes first: Participants will enter the superset, complete the demographics/consent questionnaire and then be passed to the set containing the two labelled button experiments. They will then be asked to complete either the relatedness judgements or the similarity judgements because of the type rules I have set. More information on “type” rules can be found in the sets page. 4.7 Information Sheet The information sheet should normally be placed in the introduction section on the project information page (the box labelled “Intro”), as below: It can be formatted with Markdown or HTML tags. If you use HTML tags, ensure that your opening and closing tags are matched to prevent data recording errors. Here is the flowchart view of where the information sheet should be placed, highlighted in red: 4.8 Debriefing Your debriefing information should be placed in the highest possible level component possible. In most cases this will be the top-most superset within the project This will be displayed to the participants after they have completed the component or components (depending on your design) in the superset. You can see the feedback displayed in a sample order: The debriefing information should be placed in the General Feedback section on the set information, as shown below: The General Feedback section can be formatted using Markdown or HTML tags. If you use HTML tags, ensure that your opening and closing tags are matched to prevent errors. "],

They are made up of one or more individual components, available in 3 different types: mixed, radiopage and ranking. Questionnaire Type Response Type DV Mixed Questionnaire Multiple types of questions can be combined in a single component. Variable by question type. See each questionnaire type for more information. Radiopage Multiple questions asked across a single radio button response scale Numeric value which is not seen by participants that corresponds to text labels which are seen by participants. Can incorporate automatic reverse-scoring. Rank Order A list of options which are dragged into relative rank order by participants. Rank position assigned by participants of the various items. 5.2 New Questionnaire To create a new questionnaire, navigate to the researcher’s section of the page by using the menu on the right and selecting the questionnaires option. From here, you will be able to see the questionnaires for which you have ownership status (ones you have created yourself, or ones that someone else has shared with you). To create a new questionnaire, click the button on the top right “New Questionnaire”: The following pop-up box will appear, allowing you to choose the type that you want to create: The types that you choose will depend on what type of functionality your study requires. You should note that pencil and paper questionnaires will not always be able to be copied exactly onto Experimentum. If you make any changes to questionnaires to deliver them electronically you should discuss required changes with your supervisor to ensure their validity has not been compromised. 5.3 Save Questionnaire and Reset Buttons Once you have entered information about the questionnaire you should save it. Saving regularly is good practice. Do this by pressing the save questionnaire button. The reset button is akin to a “revert” button, where any changes made after the last save can be discarded and you return to the last saved version. The JavaScript for saving the questionnaire occasionally stops working on some browsers, so we recommend saving the questionnaire after every 3 or so changes to minimise loss of work in the event of an error. Please note that the site currently does not support version control, so once you save a change the previous version will be overwritten. 5.4 Accessing and Editing Previously Saved Questionnaires To access your previously saved questionnaire component, navigate to the researcher’s area of the site by selecting “Researchers” from the menu on the right-hand side of the page. You can access your questionnaires by accessing the questionnaires section of the page by using the button below: Alternatively, if you remember the number of the questionnaire component, you can type it in to the grey rectangle in the experiments button. When you press return you will be taken straight to the information page of the questionnaires To edit the questionnaire, press the “edit” button at the top of the page and you will be taken back into the editable version: 5.5 Questionnaire Information All types of questionnaires will ask you to provide information about it, the only difference will be the Questionnaire Type, which will correspond to the type of questionnaire you have chosen on the previous pop-up box. Name for Users: this is the name of this component that will be displayed to users. Please ensure that it is appropriate. Name for Researchers: this is the name of this component for researchers. It will be displayed on lists and visible to you, your supervisor and admin staff. It should be informative and appropriate. Question Order: this indicates how you want Experimentum to display the questions contained in this component only. Fixed will display the questions to the participants in the order you have put them on this page. Random will mix the order of question presentation up automatically. Order of presentation will be recorded in your data when you download it. Limited to: limitations will only allow people in a certain age range and with a certain gender identity to complete this component of the study. If you are planning on allowing anonymous participation you should not set limitations as age and gender identity of these users will be unknown and may not be allowed to do these sections of the study if participants refuse this information. Labnotes: this is a short blurb about this component of your study. You should always add lab notes so that you, your supervisor and the admins will be able to tell what this component is about. The following sections will describe each questionnaire type and what they can do. 5.6 Questionnaire Tab The questionnaire tab on the lower half of the page is different for each questionnaire. Please see the appropriate sections below for more information on these. 5.7 Feedback Tab In most cases you should leave this empty. The feedback for the top-most set is normally where you would put your debriefing information. You can see the later sections on projects and debriefing. 5.8 Adding/Deleting Questions All questions must be given unique names within the component they are in. Components cannot be saved if you have questions with duplicate names. This applies to questions added individually or in bulk. You might find it easier to give each question across the entire study unique names. 5.8.1 Adding Individually In order to add a new question, you must ensure that all editing options are closed on the existing questions by clicking the pencil to get rid of the yellow surround or the cog to close the menu. Pressing the button at the bottom of the page will allow you to add a new question. Experimentum will add a new question by directly duplicating the previous question, with all the same text and attributes. Please ensure that you set a unique name for the new question before you attempt to save the questionnaire as questions with duplicate names will be removed by the system. The JavaScript for saving the questionnaire occasionally stops working on some browsers, so we recommend saving the questionnaire after every 3 or so changes to minimise loss of work in the event of an error. 5.8.2 Adding in Bulk It is also possible to add some types of questions in bulk by using a spreadsheet. Unfortunately, not all types are covered, but the most basic and most frequently used types are. Spreadsheet templates are available by clicking “add from spreadsheet” and selecting the underlined type of questionnaire from the options just above the buttons. Each of the column headers will relate to each of the question attributes you would use when setting the questions manually. For ranking and radiopage questionnaires not all of these headers will be applicable. Double click on the ones you do not need to remove them as I have done in the image below: Fill the template spreadsheet in and save it onto your own storage, copy the cells that contain your question information. See the section below for more about question information. Double click on the section that says, “Double-click to paste data from a spreadsheet” and paste it when in the new entry box that appears: If you do not use the template spreadsheet, but one you have made yourself, ensure that the options that you are specifying match. You can also drag the headers on the entry window from left to right to re-order them if your own spreadsheet does not match the headers here. Column Header: Refers to: Options: name dv_name (in data = q_name) Names must only contain letters, underscores and numbers (numbers must not be the first characters). question The question that you are asking the participant. Whatever you want to ask the participant. type The type of question, akin to the options selected from the menu opened by the cog * select: pulldown menu selectnum: numeric pulldown menu radio: radiobuttons radioanchor: radiobuttons with anchors datemenu: date menu text: short text options Where you would specify the response options available to the participants. Applicable to select and radio types. Numerical code, followed by “:”, and then text option. Specifying multiple by separating options using a semi-colon (;) maxlength Where you would specify the length of the response Applicable to radioanchor and text. Radioanchor: how many points in the range. Text: how many characters allowed. low_anchor Specifying the low anchor for the selected option. Applicable to selectnum, radioanchor and datemenu. Selectnum specifies the lowest number in the range of the dropdown menu Radioanchor specifies the text for low anchor Datemenu specified the lower end of the year range. high_anchor Specifying the high anchor for the selected option. Applicable to selectnum, radioanchor and datemenu. Selectnum specifies the highest number in the range of the dropdown menu Radioanchor specifies the text for high anchor Datemenu specified the higher end of the year range. Each of the three types of questionnaire component has their own template spreadsheet available for download, which are linked in the dialogue box you get when you click to “add from spreadsheet”. If you intend to add questions in bulk you should consult these spreadsheets for guidance in the first instance as examples are given. 5.8.3 Re-Order Questions If you wish to present your questions in a specific order, and this order is different than what you have in your questionnaire component, you can click on the arrows button between the dv_name and the question text to move the question up or down the order of presentation. 5.8.4 Deleting Questions Questions can be erased by clicking the picture of the trash/bin next to the question you want to delete. Please note that the site currently does not support version control, so once you save a change the previous version will be overwritten. This includes deleted questions- once you have saved the changes they are gone. 5.9 Questionnaire Types 5.9.1 Mixed Questionnaire Allows you to present multiple question types and gather multiple response types in a single component. When you select a mixed questionnaire, you will be taken to this page: As you can see you have the same questionnaire information section at the top, as you will have in all questionnaires. The differences lie in the types of questions that you can include. Mixed questionnaires can accommodate multiple types of questions on a single page. Attributes Instructions: when you click the part that says “Click here to set instructions” you will be able to enter text instructions to the participants for this entire component. You will also be able to enter Markdown and HTML code, which allows you to link to and embed additional media or format the text in specific ways. If you use HTML tags you must ensure that you have matching opening and closing tags, as unmatched ones will prevent the component from recording data. dv_name: this is the name of the dependent variable, the name that will be assigned to the column q_name in the downloaded data indicating which question the participant has answered. You should set one which is unique to this component and perhaps across all components. Question: clicking the part which says “click here to set your question” will allow you to enter the question text that the participants will see, the question that you want to ask them. Changing Question and Response Type Clicking the cog next to the question and then the arrow in the resulting menu will allow you to choose the type of question you want to set. When you have selected the type of question, you can then edit the response types that can be made by the participants by clicking the pencil next to the cog. When this editing mode is active, the response section will be unfolded, and will be displayed with a yellow surround. You must close this editing mode by clicking the pencil a second time, getting rid of the yellow surround, before you add a new question, click the cog or save the questionnaire. Question Types Pulldown Menu: pulldown menus give your participants a set of text option responses to choose from. Each text option has a numeric coding value associated with it, which will be the returned value in the downloaded data in place of the text. This is specified before the colon. The text options are specified after the colon, these are not returned in the data. Each text value should be associated with a unique numerical coding value, non-unique numerical codes will be deleted upon saving the questionnaire. You can add multiple options to the menu. Numeric Pulldown Menu: this allows you to set numerical values to a pulldown menu, with no associated text label. The range that is set is the range that will be displayed to the user, as below. You should use whole numbers only. Slider: sliders provide you with a way for participants to return a finer-grained numerical response on a spectrum between two anchor points. A slider scale will be displayed to participants, with the low end of the range associated with the low anchor, and the high end the high anchor. Participants will move a slider along the scale, and a numerical value associated with the position they put it in returned in the data. You set the scale limits and increments, in this example from 0 to 100 in increments of 1. You can also change the text anchors by clicking on them as shown here. Slider knobs do not appear until the participant has clicked somewhere on the scale. Radio Buttons with Anchors: this option allows you to set a scale with a low anchor and a high anchor, which you can change by clicking the text. You can add or remove points to the scale by pressing the + and – buttons on either side of the response. On this scale example below, a number will be returned associated with the point on the scale the participant submitted, here 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Date Menu: date menus allow the participants to choose a specific date. You can set the range of dates to choose from, in the example below the participant is allowed to go back 100 years from the current date (-100y) but cannot go further into the future than today (+0y). When participants click on the response, they will be given a calendar to pick from, instead of typing the date. Time: This allows participants to enter a time, in 24 hour format, using hours and minutes. You can change the response options (from single minutes to increments of 15, for example), but it is not advised. Countries: participants can choose from a list countries. Returned in the data as the two letter ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 code. Short Text: allows participants to enter free-response text up to and including 255 characters. Returned in the data as character strings. The maximum number of characters can be changed by changing the number after maxlength:. Long Text: allows participants to enter free-response text over 255 characters. Returned in the data as character strings. If you do not need more than 255 characters, please use the short text to minimise strain on the server. Message: allows you to put a line of text into a questionnaire which does not require a response amongst other questions. Note that to ensure that this appears where it should that these questions should be presented in a fixed order. 5.9.2 Radiopage Radiopage questionnaires contain the same questionnaire information section at the top of the page as a Mixed Questionnaire. The format of this questionnaire allows the user to set a number of questions with radio button responses on a single page, with a single response scale for all questions. Each point on the scale has its own text label, and an “option value” number associated with it, rather than only the two extremities of a multiple point scale as in the radio buttons with anchors in the mixed questionnaire. Attributes Instructions: when you click the part that says “Click here to set instructions” you will be able to enter text instructions to the participants for this entire component. You will also be able to enter Markdown and HTML code, which allows you to link to and embed additional media or format the text in specific ways. See stimuli for more information on this. Option values: these are the numerical equivalents of the text labels for each of the responses a participant can make to any question on the page. This number is not displayed to participants. The number you set is largely arbitrary, but the numerical figure associates with the choice rendered by participants is returned in the data set upon download and text values are not. You will need to know what number corresponds to which text response in order to carry out and interpret your analyses. It is possible to have automatic reverse scoring- see here for more information. Option text: this is the text label associated with each response the participant can make to any question on the page. The associated text is what the participant sees, and it is displayed in the construction page directly below the numerical value you set. The option text is not returned in the downloaded data set. Adding/removing options: you can add or remove the number of response options on the scale you give to participants by pressing the + or – symbols in circles on the right of the scale at the top of the questionnaire. dv_name: this is the name of the dependent variable, the name that will be assigned to the column q_name in the downloaded data indicating which question the participant has answered. You should set one which is unique within this component, or perhaps across all components in your study. Question: clicking the part which says “click here to set your question” will allow you to enter the question text that the participants will see, the question that you want to ask them. Forward and Reverse Scoring In many questionnaires it is common to find items which should be “reverse-scored”. Here you can indicate if the question is forward or reverse scored, and the system will make the changes to the data for you, saving you from having to recode them later. Example: your scale at the top indicates 1-5 as below. As you can see “much less than average” is associated option value of 1. The forward scored question is marked “fwd” in the pulldown menu on the right of the table and the reverse scored question is marked “rev”. If a participant chooses “much less than average” on a forward scored question the dv in the output will be “1”. But what happens to the reverse scored question? This is the data output here. As you can see where the participant chose the option that returned a “1” for the forward scored question, for the reverse scored question that same choice returns a “5” in the data. 5.9.3 Rank Order Attributes Ranking questionnaires present a list of text options to participants to put into a specific order, based on some judgement they are asked to make on them. As you can see, there is a single response type associated with this questionnaire type. The DV in this case will be the rank position assigned by the participants. Setting the order to fixed will set the initial order up on the order you have specified on the questionnaire editing page and random will randomise it. Each question will be an option in the list of items to rank order. Participants will be able to drag each text item to rank order them, with the number specified in the column next to the text. The final presentation to participants looks like this: In the data, the question name is saved as q_name and the rank order assigned by the participant is saved as the dv in the downloaded data: 5.10 Using Stimuli with Questionnaires In some cases you might wish to include some stimuli with a questionnaire. For example, you might want to present an image with a set of questions asking the user’s opinions about that image. We would recommend that you upload your image as per the instructions given in the stimuli page and use HTML or Markdown in the instructions at the top of the questionnaire component that you want to display the stimuli on. First, you will need to find the path of the stimuli you have uploaded to the server by going to “My Uploaded Stimuli” by navigating to “Researchers” &gt; “Stimuli” &gt; “Upload Stimuli” and looking in the folders at the bottom of the page. Find the image that you want to use and click on it in the folders. It will display on the right hand side and the file path will be above it. Copy the file path, seen circled here: Next you will need to paste that into the introduction box using an appropriate image tag. Here you can see the HTML syntax to link to an image: The code is: &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;file/path/here.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt; width=500px alters the image displayed by resizing the image to be 500 pixels wide whilst maintaining the aspect ratio. This is OK for one or two images, but if you are doing this with many images we would recommend that you resize the stimuli before uploading them. &lt;center&gt; ensures that the image stays in the middle of the page. &lt;/center&gt; is a “closing tag” and must be put in place to ensure that data for the component is saved to the server. When participants go through the questionnaire this is what they will see: This method works for all types of compatible stimuli, although the code used to display them will vary. For audio: &lt;center&gt;&lt;audio controls&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;file/path/here.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;&gt; Your browser does not support the audio element. &lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/center&gt; Displayed as a small media player: And for video: &lt;center&gt;&lt;video width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; controls&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;file/path/here.m4v&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt; Your browser does not support the video tag. &lt;/video&gt;&lt;/center&gt; Whilst you can link to externally hosted stimuli we would recommend that if possible you upload your stimuli to our server. This will ensure uninterrupted access to your media. We cannot always host all stimuli. Files larger than 3mb each should be uploaded elsewhere to suitable platforms, such as YouTube, as loading times are often too long for files which exceed this limit. Embedding media from outside sources may require different code than provided above. See the stimuli page for further information on preprocessing and uploading stimuli. "],

To create a new experiment component, navigate to the “researchers” section by using the menu on the right side of the page. This is an overview of the types of experimental components avaible to you: Experiment Type Response Type DV 2AFC Alternative forced-choice with 2 options. Binary, defaulted to 0 or 1 assigned depending on how you assign the stimuli to trials. 2-AFC with 8 button strength of choice Alternative forced-choice between two stimuli, but with the addition of strength of preference for the choice made on an 8-point scale. Out of 8, with 0-3 indicating strength of choice in one direction for one piece of stimuli and 4-7 indicating strength of choice in the other direction for the other piece of stimuli. Labelled Buttons Display 1, 2 or 3 stimuli items and participants respond on a scale set by the researcher. Akin to a Likert scale. A numerical value corresponding to the values set by the researcher. Slider A sliding scale between two numerical points where the number is not displayed to participants. Numerical, between upper and lower bounds and at increments set by the researcher. X-AFC Alternative forced-choice with more than 2 options. Participants pick only one. DV is a number which corresponds to the column the chosen stimuli item is assigned to on the stimuli assignment page, ranging from 1 to X. Sorting Participants put stimuli in order of some specified preference by dragging them into position on the screen Number of times participants changed the order and the order the stimuli was placed in. Also provides stimuli original order of presentation. Slideshow Timed display of stimuli items where participants are only asked to watch, with no data collected or rendered. Usually used as a precursor to another component. None. These will be covered in further detail in the section on experimental component types. Some types require specific considerations in the interpretation of the data, assignment of stimuli, etc. Please read the one(s) that concern you carefully. You are also given a look at the view the participants will see in an individual trial for each type. 6.2 Creating a New Component Click on the “New experiment” button at the top of the page to create a new experiment, and select the type of experiment that you want to make from the dialogue box: This displays all of currently available experimental component types available for you to use. 6.2.1 Experiment Information All experiment types have a generic information fields in common, but some have extra depending on their functionality. Each of the options common across all types of experiment will be discussed in the following section. Where information is specific to a certain type of experiment it will be specified in brackets what type of experiment it refers to. You should make your information section as detailed as possible to remind your future self of what you have done, but also to explain what you have done to your supervisor(s) and the admins who will use this information to provide support. Here is an information section from a 2-AFC questionnaire for reference: Name for Users: this is the name of this component that will be displayed to users. Please ensure that it is suitable. Name for Researchers: this is the name of this component for researchers. It will be displayed on lists and visible to you, your supervisor and admin staff. It should be informative and appropriate. Design: within or between subjects, allow for multiple completions or single completion only. Slider range: (slider only). This determines the numerical value associated with each position on the slider, and the increments along it. Trial Order: this indicates how you want Experimentum to display the individual trials contained in this component only. Fixed will display the trials in the order set on the “edit trials” section later. Random will mix the order of question presentation up automatically. Order of presentation will be recorded in your data when you download it. Image side: (2-AFC, 2-AFC with 8 button strength of choice only). Fixed will display images on the side specified in the “edit trials” section later. Random will switch the side of presentation randomly. Side of presentation will be recorded in your data. Images: allows you to present a subset of your stimuli to your participants. For example, if you have 40 pairs of faces from which to choose the more trustworthy, you can present a subset of 20 pairs of faces to each participant by setting this to “Show 20 of 40 total images”. Limited to: limitations will only allow people in a certain age range and with a certain gender identity to complete this component of the study. If you are planning on allowing anonymous participation you should not set limitations as age and gender identity of these users will be unknown, and they will not be allowed to do these sections of the study if they refuse to submit this information. Labnotes: this is a short blurb about this component of your study. You should always add lab notes so that you, your supervisor and the admins will be able to tell what this component is about. Number of images to display: this specifies the number of images to display per trial. You may wish to display 1, 2 or more depending on your design. 6.2.1.1 Experiment info: what are these tabs? All experiment components will present you with 3 tabs under the experiment information section. The following section discusses when the participants will see them, and make suggestions on how you may want to use these. Introduction Tab Before each component starts to run participants will be greeted with a short introduction to the component. You should include some instructions to the participants here. Here is an example from the 2 AFC type of experiment: The text above will appear to the participants immediately prior to the start of the first trial: This text can be formatted with HTML or Markdown code. If you use HTML tags you must ensure that you have matching opening and closing tags, as unmatched ones will prevent the component from recording data. Experiment Tab Once you have written your instructions to your participants, click on the experiment tab next to introduction. Set the question here if the question is to remain the same across all trials within this component. If you choose to leave the question blank, delete the question and “{{blank}}” will be displayed above the stimuli images on this tab, and will be empty on each trial displayed to participants. If you wish to have the question vary by trial, you should leave the question blank. When you come to assign stimuli to trials you can type in questions according to which trial is being displayed. If your experiment uses a scale with anchor points or text labels for buttons, you would click them to edit in the same way as the questions. Here is an example from the Slider type experiment, where there are anchors at the left and right most extremes of the scale: An example of changing participant-facing button labels in a labelled button experiment: Check that the number of stimuli displayed on this page are correct. Here, the “blankface” image is displayed as a placeholder for your own stimuli, regardless of the type of stimuli you are placing/have already placed. Then check that the number of trials is correct at the bottom of the page too. Feedback Tab Generally, the feedback tab in individual components should be left alone. This will be covered later in the section covering Debriefing. 6.3 Saving your Component Saving experiments differs slightly from saving questionnaires. When you save an experiment, you will be taken to the trial editing page (see individual experiment types on how to fill in your stimuli). The reset button remains the same, it will revert to the last saved version of the experiment: 6.4 Accessing and Editing Previously Saved Experiments To access your previously saved experiment component, navigate to the researcher’s area of the site by selecting “Researchers” from the menu on the right-hand side of the page. You can access your experiments by accessing the experiments section of the page by using the button below: Alternatively, if you remember the number of the experiment component, you can type it in to the grey rectangle in the experiments button. When you press return you will be taken straight to the information page of the experiment. To edit the experiment, press the “edit” button at the top of the page and you will be taken back into the editable version: If you edit and save changes to a component which is currently active you will deactivate it. If you are a student researcher this will mean you will need to contact your supervisor again to re-activate it. 6.5 Types of Experiments There are different types of experimental components for you to choose from. They each have their own features, response types and type of DV that they return in your data. The following section will discuss each of the options available to you. 6.5.1 2-AFC 2-AFC experiments present participants with 2 options and ask them to make a choice between them. Here you will present 2 stimuli items together and ask participants to make a binary judgment between the two by clicking on one item only. The DV returned will be either a 1 or a 0, depending on the choice the participant makes and what stimuli item you define as a 1 or a 0 when you assign stimuli to trials (see Notes specific to 2-AFC below). Open a new experiment by clicking the “new experiment” button on the researcher’s page and select 2-AFC from the dialogue box: First, you should complete the experiment information at the top of the page, then set instructions on the introduction tab. For example, I have 12 pairs of faces in my Mooney faces set that I uploaded in the uploading stimuli section, so I would change the number of total images to 12. Once you have finished on this page and press “Save” you will be taken to the page that allows you to assign stimuli , assign trial names and (if applicable) individual questions for the trials. Notes Specific to 2-AFC Assigning Stimuli to Trials NEEDS SOMETHING HERE Interpretting the Data When you assign stimuli to the 2-AFC be sure that you assign the correct stimuli according to the DV that you expect to be returned. In the screenshot below you can see that one column corresponds to a DV of 1 and the other a DV of 0. Ensure that you assign the stimuli you wish to return a DV of 1 and the stimuli you wish to return a DV of 0 to the appropriate columns. Participant View When this experimental component is presented to the participants it will look like this: 6.5.2 2-AFC with 8-Button Strength of Choice (JND) For the most part, the 2-AFC with 8 button strength of choice is largely the same as the binary 2-ACF experiment type in its presentation, but the question being asked and the DV rendered by participants differ. You will still be asking participants to compare the two stimuli pieces and render a judgement. Instead of asking them to pick one, you will be asking them to pick one and indicate the strength of their choice. This type is also referred to as the large_n JND type in the component information page. Open a new experiment by clicking the “new experiment” button on the researchers’ page and select 2-AFC with 8-button strength of choice from the dialogue box: First, you should complete the experiment information at the top of the page, then set instructions on the introduction tab. For example, I have 12 pairs of faces in my Mooney faces set that I uploaded earlier in the uploading stimuli section, so I would change the number of total images to 12. Once you have finished on this page and press “Save” you will be taken to the page that allows you to assign stimuli , assign trial names and (if applicable) individual questions for the trials. Notes Specific to 2-AFC with 8-Button Strength of Choice Assigning Stimuli As in the 2-AFC, the way that you assign stimuli matters. Stimuli assigned to the first column will return a DV from the range of 4 to 7 if chosen and those assigned to the second column will return a DV from the range of 0-3 if chosen, depending on the strength of choice indicated by participants. Interpreting the Data Output What I have done here is assign the female images to return a higher range of the DV than the male images, treating the threshold between 3 and 4 to be the cut-off between judgments of male and female. In the data it looks like this: You can see from the combination of my assignment of the stimuli to specific DV ranges and strength of choice indicated in the data that I perceive the females from pair_7 and pair_1 to be more feminine in appearance than females from pair_5 and pair_10. Participant View The two stimuli items are displayed as below, with the buttons that participants would press being the text in the 8 boxes at the top. It looks like this: Considering how I assigned my stimuli, the strength of choice buttons on the left side: Much more = 7 More = 6 Somewhat more = 5 Slightly more = 4 And on the right side: Slightly more = 3 Somewhat more = 2 More = 1 Much more = 0 6.5.3 Labelled Buttons The Labelled Buttons experiment type allows you to work with 1, 2 or 3 pieces of stimuli and participants to make a response akin to a Likert scale response. Open a new experiment by clicking the “new experiment” button on the researchers’ page and select Labelled Buttons from the dialogue box: First, you should complete the experiment information at the top of the page, then set instructions on the introduction tab. For example, I have 12 pairs of faces in my Mooney faces set that I uploaded earlier in the uploading stimuli section, so I would change the number of total images to 12. Once you have finished on this page and press “Save” you will be taken to the page that allows you to assign stimuli , assign trial names and (if applicable) individual questions for the trials. Notes Specific to Labelled Buttons Length of the Scale, Setting Text Labels, DV values and Scale Anchors When can add or remove points along the DV scale by pressing the + or - buttons, and either delete or set high and low anchors for the scale. As you can see, each point is associated with a numerical DV. This can also be changed by clicking on it if you wish. Each point on the scale is set as numerical by default, but you can also include text prompts. The DV returned in the data is displayed above each of the labelled buttons. This can also be changed: Assigning Stimuli to Trials Assigning stimuli to trials does not impact the DV in the same way as the 2-AFC options do in that the columns do not correspond to the value returned. Notice there are no black panels with DVs or DV ranges specified above the columns: The value of the DV will come from the buttons of the scale. The DV value is the one that is displayed above the scale when you are viewing the eperiment tab. Interpretting the Data NEEDS SOMETHING HERE Participant View This is how a 7 labelled button scale appears to participants: 6.5.4 Sliders Slider experimental components allow you to display 1, 2 or 3 pieces of stimuli and allow participants to make a response along an unlabelled slider, which returns a numerical value depending on where they place the knob of the slider. Open a new experiment by clicking the “new experiment” button on the researchers’ page and select Slider from the dialogue box: First, you should complete the experiment information at the top of the page, then set instructions on the introduction tab. For example, I have 12 pairs of faces in my Mooney faces set that I uploaded earlier in the uploading stimuli section. In this example I am presenting them one at a time rather than in pairs, so I change the number of images to 24. Sliders ranges will accept numerical values over a very wide range (tested -9999 to +9999), but you should be realistic about the values that you set. You should also change the increment to one that is suitable. Once you have finished on this page and press “Save” you will be taken to the page that allows you to assign stimuli , assign trial names and (if applicable) individual questions for the trials. Notes Specific to Sliders Assigning Stimuli to Trials Specific columns on the assignment screen do not carry specific DV values, as indicated by the lack of the black panels above them: Interpretting the Data NEEDS SOMETHING HERE Participant View This is what the slider experiment with a single image looks like to participants: The knob on the slider will only appear once the participant clicks on the scale for the first time. Note that the DV (the numerical value associated with the position the knob is placed in) is not displayed to participants. Once they have moved the knob to a position and they are happy with their decision they should press the forward arrow on the top of the right-hand side of the screen to progress to the next trial (circled above). 6.5.5 X-Alternative Forced Choice (X-AFC) The XAFC is essentially an extension of the 2-AFC experiment type, allowing you to present anywhere from 3 to 10 stimuli items to participants per trial and to pick one of the items presented. Open a new experiment by clicking the “new experiment” button on the researchers’ page and select X-AFC from the dialogue box: First, you should complete the experiment information at the top of the page, then set instructions on the introduction tab. Here I am presenting a subset of 6 trials using the stimuli I uploaded earlier in the uploading stimuli section. In this example I am presenting triplets of images, the Mooney faces with some photographic images from the Face Research Lab London image set (DeBruine and Jones, 2017). Participants will be asked to select the photograph. Notes Specific to X-AFC Assigning Stimuli to Trials Despite the lack of black panels above the columns on the assignment page, the DV values do correspond to specific items of stimuli. If, for example, participants experiencing the first trial (first row) from the screenshot above choose option 3, the value of 3 will be presented in the data under the DV column. Interpretting the Data NEEDS SOMETHING HERE Participant view This is what the X-AFC looks like, with 3 stimuli items displayed: new image required 6.5.6 Sorting The sorting experimental component type asks participants to place items of stimuli in an order that you specify to them. This is like a rank ordering questionnaire, but it records slightly different data and allows you to use stimuli other than text. Open a new experiment by clicking the “new experiment” button on the researchers’ page and select Sorting from the dialogue box: First, you should complete the experiment information at the top of the page, then set instructions on the introduction tab. Once you have finished on this page and press “Save” you will be taken to the page that allows you to assign stimuli , assign trial names and (if applicable) individual questions for the trials. Here you can see that each row (representing an individual trial) will have 5 images presented. I set image side to randomisation on the information page so the presentation will not be kept in order of the columns here. Notes Specific to Sorting Components Assigning Stimuli and DV Values For this experiment I am using Ishihara colour deficiency plate test items. These use images of numbers made up of dots in specific colours, which cannot be perceived by those who experience colour perception deficiency. This example contains numbers which the participant should sort into order. If the participant can successfully order the numbers in a small number of changes then we should be able to assume that they can perceive the shape of the number in the circle. Those who cannot experience colour deficiency may make more mistakes in ordering the numbers. The sets used here test for deuteranopia, the most common type of colour deficiency. As you can see, I have numbered the stimuli in a systematic way: “ishihara_x_y.jpg”, where x is the number displayed in the circle and y is the set that it belongs in. By searching for “ishihara_5” I have found all images which have this string in their file name, resulting in the display of two images of the number 5 from set one and two, displayed on the right of the image below. As I am displaying 5 images per trial, there are 5 columns on the stimuli assignment page. By double clicking on the first box in column 5, the system inserts all of the files found into that column in the order shown in the search results. Stimuli items set in the first column return a DV of 1, the second a DV of 2 and so on, even though there is no black block at the top of each column to specify this. This will mean that the order of assignment on this page will influence how you come to interpret your data output. This is partially why I have named my stimuli as “ishihara_x_y.jpg”, where x represents the number displayed in the image. It helps me establish where to place the item in the stimuli assignment columns. Interpretting the Data The DV and side variables in the downloaded datasets for the sorting experiments are slightly different and need to be interpreted differently. session_id: experimental session ID. Each time a participant completes the study they will be assigned a new session ID. You should discourage participants from completing more than one study at a time to ensure that the session ID remains unique to your project. Please instruct users to close their browser between studies to ensure this happens. project_id: the number of the project that contained the component when this line of data was generated. Here it displays 0 because the component was not in a project when I tested it. exp_id: the number assigned to the experiment by the system. user_id: the user number. For registered users this will be a permanent assignment, for anonymous users a throwaway number will be assigned for this session only. user_sex: user sex, as taken from either a registered user’s profile or submitted in the dialogue box for anonymous users displayed at the start of each study. user_status: the users’ status. Admin, res, student or guest profile types. user_age: user age, as taken from either a registered user’s profile or submitted in the dialogue box for anonymous users displayed at the start of each study. trial_name: name of the trial assigned by you in the stimuli assignment page, or the default of t1, t2, etc. trial_n: the number of the trial, indicating row from the stimuli assignment page. order: the number of the trial encountered by the user, indicating the order which the participant completed the trials. dv: a series of numbers is provided in the sorting experiment. Taking the first data line displayed below, indicating “3:1;2;3;4;5”, the 3 preceding the colon (:) indicates that the user moved the stimuli items 3 times in total to settle on the order that they did. The numbers after the colon, separated by the semi-colons (;) indicate the order that the stimuli items were placed in. In our Ishihara example, the stimuli were assigned in the order of 1,2,3,4 and 5. This means that on this trial the participant was able to place the stimuli in the correct order using only 3 moves. rt: reaction time. Only serves as an indicator, as you cannot really predict the conditions of each participant’s internet connection and any latency issues associated with them. side: the original order of the stimuli displayed on the page before the participant manipulated them. dt: date and time of the submission of this line of the data. Participant View Here is what the sorting task looks like to participants, with the top image is the initial presentation, and the second image shows one image being dragged to a different position in the presentation: 6.5.7 Slideshow Slideshows are used to display stimuli to participants in combination with other experimental components or questionnaires. They do not allow participants to make any decisions and collect no data from them. Later, you will learn about sets where you can combine this sort of stimuli presentation with other components. Open a new experiment by clicking the “new experiment” button on the researcher’s page and select Slideshow from the dialogue box: First, you should complete the experiment information at the top of the page, then set instructions on the introduction tab. Once you have finished on this page and press “Save” you will be taken to the page that allows you to assign stimuli , assign trial names and (if applicable) individual questions for the trials. Here you can see that each row (representing an individual trial) will have 3 images presented. Notes Specific to Slideshows Interpretting the Data Output The slideshow is a way to present stimuli to participants, but it does not allow participants to provide any sort of input and as a result it does not return any DV based on a participant response. Depending on your aim, you may wish to pay more attention to variables such as order and side which give you information about how the stimuli was presented. This might be useful when you combine slideshows with components which do take collect data from participants. session_id: experimental session ID. Each time a participant completes the study they will be assigned a new session ID. You should discourage participants from completing more than one study at a time to ensure that the session ID remains unique to your project. Please instruct users to close their browser between studies to ensure this happens. project_id: the number of the project that contained the component when this line of data was generated. Here it displays 0 because the component was not in a project when I tested it. exp_id: the number assigned to the experiment by the system. user_id: the user number. For registered users this will be a permanent assignment, for anonymous users a throwaway number will be assigned for this session only. user_sex: user sex, as taken from either a registered user’s profile or submitted in the dialogue box for anonymous users displayed at the start of each study. user_status: the users’ status. Admin, res, student or guest profile types. user_age: user age, as taken from either a registered user’s profile or submitted in the dialogue box for anonymous users displayed at the start of each study. trial_name: name of the trial assigned by you in the stimuli assignment page, or the default of t1, t2, etc. trial_n: the number of the trial, indicating row from the stimuli assignment page. order: the number of the trial encountered by the user, indicating the order which the participant completed the trials. dv: will all be zero on a slideshow, as there is no response recorded from the participants. rt: reaction time, in this case should be almost equivalent to the increment time that you set on the information page. It won’t be a perfect match due to issues with internet connectivity. side: the side that the stimuli was displayed on. Irrelevant in this case. dt: date and time of the submission of this line of the data. Participant View A slideshow with no questions on each trial will look like this: Images are displayed without a question and the participant cannot make any responses, they only view the stimuli. 6.6 Assigning Stimuli to Trials Once you have constructed an experiment you will assign stimuli to the trials. This is what the page to assign stimuli to trials looks like for a simple 2-AFC experiment: "],

Individual questionnaire or experimental components alone are not much use. In order to make our studies we will always need to group components together to make them work. We do this by placing them in sets, another type of component, which also allow us to make decisions on which participants see what components and the order of their presentation. A set here refers to a set which contains only questionnaire and experimental components. A superset is a set which contains other sets nested inside of it, which may or may not also hold individual questionnaire or experimental components with those sets. 7.2 Creating a New Set To create a set, navigate to the researcher’s section of the site using the menu at the right side of the page and click on sets. Next, click on the “New set” button at the top of the page to create a new set: You will be brought to a page which allows you to enter information about your set: This is very similar to the questionnaire and experiment information you would have completed for each of your individual components. The information requested is as follows: Name for researchers: This is the name of the set that will be displayed to the researchers. Make sure that it is informative and appropriate. Name for Participants: This is the name of the set that will be displayed to participants. Make sure that it is informative and appropriate. Type: This rule determines how the participants will see the items within this set only: Fixed order: participants will do each component of the set in the order they are placed in the set by you. Random order: participants will do each component of the set, but in an order randomly generated by the system. One of (random): participants will do only one of the items in the set, determined randomly by the system. Show to: gender limitations of this set. If you are allowing for anonymous participation you should not be setting gender limitations. Age limits: Age range limitations. If you are allowing for anonymous participation you should not be setting age limitations. Labnotes: this is a note to tell yourself, your supervisor, other researchers and the admins exactly what this set is about. Please complete this to the fullest of your ability. General feedback: equivalent to the feedback tab in a questionnaire or experiment component. See the Debriefing section before filling in any feedback on components or sets. It may be that you construct a set for each condition of your IV and have participants randomly assigned to them. You should note that we are not able to guarantee equal numbers across each of these. You may need to monitor your study carefully and ask your supervisor or the admins to archive parts of your study to try to achieve approximately equal numbers. 7.3 Saving Your Sets When you create a set you will be asked to fill in the set information, as detailed above. When you have done this and populated the set with the components that you require click on the “Save” button on the top left of the page. Just like questionnaire and experimental components, sets are assigned a number for future reference. 7.4 Viewing and Editing Existing Sets To view the sets that you have previously made navigate to the “Sets” area of the “Researchers” area of the website by clicking the button: Here you will see the sets that you have made and can click on them to be taken to their information page. Alternatively, if you remember the number of the set, you can type the number into the box in the button to be taken directly to it. To edit the set, press the “Edit” button on the top left of the page. 7.5 Adding Components to Your Set At the bottom of the set page you will see that the page is split into two sections. On the left you have a part which shows you things you can put into your set and on the right the current contents of the set. This new set is empty. I can use the buttons next to “View Items” on the right to show me the available experimental components, questionnaire components and other sets (more in “Supersets: sets of sets”). By clicking on the appropriate button, I can switch views between the different types of components that I want to place in my set: I can use the search box to either search by using the number assigned to the components I have created or search for the name for researchers that I gave them earlier: I can then click on the one that I want which will place it into the current Set List on the right-hand side. I can do this with multiple items to fill the set out: In the example above I might place a slideshow followed by an X-AFC experimental component to be presented in a fixed order. This might be a useful setup for testing recall of faces, where the slideshow presents a selection of visual stimuli and then participant recall is tested using an X-AFC test. 7.5.1 Component Statuses This page also allows you to see the current status of the items you can place in your set. The A relates to items which are active, and the T denotes those which are still in test mode and cannot be viewed by participants: 7.6 Supersets: Sets of Sets Sometimes a single set is not enough. Sometimes you need to use a combination of different “type” rules to structure a research project to achieve your study’s design. This will require you to create sets with your individual questionnaire or experimental components inside, but to also put these sets within other sets. These sets of sets are referred to as “supersets”. They can also contain individual components with other sets. Using a combination of components, sets, supersets and type rules you can come up with lots of combinations of study designs, allowing the system to meet a wide range of researcher’s needs. 7.7 Set/Superset Structure 7.7.1 “Type” Rules 7.7.2 Participant View You should run through your study as if you were a participant. Instructions on how to do this are in the testing your study section. 7.7.3 Info Page View You can examine the overall set/superset structure by selecting the set you want to look at from the “Sets” menu in the Researchers section of the website and scrolling down to the bottom of the page: Here you can see that the current set (734) contains other sets (set 666 and superset 735). These two sets are presented in a fixed order. Each set’s own type rules are displayed under the “Type” column, which allows you to work out the order of presentation of all the components and sets within. It can be interpreted as follows: Participants enter into set 734 and are passed into set 666, where they will complete components quest_1790 and 1791 in fixed order. Participants are then passed to set 735, which contains set 292 and set 293, presented in random order. Participants will complete one and then the other in a randomised order. Both set 292 and 293 are “random”, which means that the components within them are presented in a randomised order within that set. This is a simple example, but the same principles apply to more complex designs with more components and sets. Similar information is provided on Project information pages, which allow you to make the same deductions about the delivery of your whole project. 7.7.4 Sample Order It is also advisable to use the “Test” button at the top of the page to get a “sample order” of the delivery of the project. Pressing this button simulates how participants willmove through the set: Here you can get a run down of what participants will see and in what order. I pressed the button and I can see that participants complete: quest_1790 (consent form) quest_1791 (demographics) They are passed to set 293, where participants complete: quest_1 (mixed questionnaire test) quest_650 (rank questionnaire test) quest_2 (radiopage questionnaire test) Participants are then passed to set 292, where they complete: exp 178 (2-AFC test) exp 180 (labelled buttons test) exp 179 (2-AFC with 8 button strength of choice test) exp 186 (sorting test) exp 184 (X-AFC test) Finally, participants then are presented with feedback from set 734. This is our top-most set and the feedback section of this contains our debriefing information. See Debriefing for more information on this part. 7.8 Filtering Participants Using Sets As the system does not allow for server side calculations we normally cannot filter participants based on any scoring from questionnaires, experiments or any other sort of criteria. There is, however, one simple filteration you can do using sets where participants, upon immediately entering the study, will be asked to self-select into one category or another. See the section in Projects for more information on how this is done. "],

This will give it a URL for you to direct potential participants to and mean that your supervisor can make it active- essentially switch it on. 8.2 Creating a New Project Navigate to the researcher’s page using the menu on the right-hand side of the page. You will then be taken to a page where you can select “Projects”: After clicking “Projects” you will be taken to a page with all your currently saved projects, with the option to start a new project by pressing a button at the top of the page, as shown here: After this you will be taken to the new project information page. Just like any other component or set, you will need to set the information for the project. The following information is required: Name for participants: This is the name that will be displayed to the participants when they click on your link, but also the name that appears on the “Studies” page that registered can access. Ensure that it is informative and appropriate. Name for researchers: this is the name that will be displayed to other researchers. Ensure that it is informative and appropriate. URL: this allows you to set the last part of the URL (the link) that you can disseminate to potential participants. It will be automatically stuck on to the rest of the site’s address and you will be given the full address below the URL box, as shown in the image below. The text you enter here should be unique from other projects on the site. You will be told if the text you have entered is available: Blurb: this is a short description of your study that will be displayed to potential participants on the “Studies” page that registered users can access. Ensure that it is informative, appropriate and concise to prevent taking up too much space on the page. Intro: This is the information about the project. This is typically where you would place the information sheet for the study. It can be formatted with Markdown or HTML tags. If you use HTML tags, ensure that your opening and closing tags are matched to prevent data recording errors. Show to: Gender identity-based limitations. If you are planning to use anonymous participation you should not place limitations here. Age limits: age range-based limitations. If you are planning to use anonymous participation you should not place limitations here. Labnotes: These notes inform your future self, your supervisor and admins about your study. Ensure that you fill this in and that it is informative and appropriate. 8.3 Viewing and Editing Existing Projects 8.4 Adding Sets and Components Just as in the sets, you will add items to your project from the project information page. Typically, you will be looking to insert sets into the project but you can add individual components if required. You can search for what you are looking to insert by clicking the appropriate button next to “View Items” and either searching by the number assigned to that item or the “name for researchers” that you assigned it by typing in the search box. Click the option from the available components list on the left-hand side to move it into your project. You can also remove items by double-clicking it in the project list on the left. Component Statuses This page also allows you to see the current status of the items you can place in your project. The green A relates to items which are active, and the red T denotes those which are still in test mode and unavailable to participants: Filtering Participants Using Sets It is not currently possible to filter participants in studies using any sort of server-side calculations, such as a calculated score from a screening questionnaire. At the moment the only filtering tool is based on placing more than one set/superset within a project and allowing participants to self-select to a category. In most cases we would contain all components/sets within one superset and placing that set into the project. This allows for one single path for the participants to take. In some circumstances you might want to examine the difference between two different categories of participants who need to be assigned to specific branches of a study based on their characteristics. For example, imagine I want to examine what people find attractive in potential partners. I want to also examine the motivations of those who are using dating apps- not all people seeking romantic partners will use dating apps! I could create one study with all components and ask those who do not use dating apps to skip the questions that do not apply to them. I could also create a set for each type of user (dating app users versus non-users) with an added component asking about dating app users motivations only into the set for dating app users. I can then place two sets into the project, allowing the participants to self-select between the two branches: This is what the choice will look like to the participants: This is likely to be of limited use to most people running studies through the site, but the option is available for those who might find it useful. Icons Unlike sets, your project information page has a button labelled “Icons”. You can use this to assign small icons to things in your set. Here I have searched for a clipart of a beaker, and I can drag that image tile to the set I want to assign it to: After I have dragged it across the image will be assigned to that set: When participants enter your study, the set will be assigned that clip art: When you place your items in the project and participants navigate to it, they will see a button for each item within your project. In most cases this will only be a single button instead of the two shown here. 8.5 Debriefs Debreifing information should be put in the feedback tab of the top-most set of the project. See the sections in Planning Your Study for more information. 8.6 Project URLs In order for participants to access your study you will need to provide them with a URL suffix (a web link/address). Each URL needs to be unique. For Experimentum, full URLs usually follow a set pattern (where XXXXX is a suffix that you assign to your project): exp.psy.gla.ac.ukproject?XXXXX This URL suffix is set in the project information page in the URL box: In order for your project to be accessible you should enter only the URL suffix in the URL box, omitting the “exp.psy.gla.ac.ukproject?” part. Specify the suffix in the box labelled URL. It should not contain special characters, so you can see here where I would have a space I have placed an underscore: The text underneath indicates if your chosen suffix is available. The suffix does not need to be anything specific, but it should be appropriate for public display. This full URL will be what you share with potential participant- exp.psy.gla.ac.ukproject?XXXXX. If you wish to enable anonymous participation there are further additions that need to be made. These are discussed in the section about anonymous participation. 8.7 Project Structure 8.8 Testing Your Study Before you ask your supervisor to activate your project it is important to test it extensively. There are a number of ways that you should do this. 8.8.1 Examining Structure Participant View It is important that you test your study from th viewpoint of a participant. You can do this by navigating to the project information and pressing the “Go” button at the top of the page: This will run you through your study as if you were a participant. It will also generate test data which will allow you to examine the output, ensure that you can interpret the data before you run your project with real participants and allow you to remove test data easily. You should download and retain test data before your project is activated. This will allow you to filter out the test data from the real data easily at the analysis stage. Info Page View As in sets you can work out the structure of the study by looking at the project info page. You can see how to do this in the testing your study section of the sets page. Sample Order As in sets, you can also use sample order to examine how the participants will progress through your study by examining a “sample order” of the components. You can see how to do this and interpret the output in the sample order section of the sets page. 8.9 Activating Projects When you create your study it will be in “test” mode. This allows you to see it, make changes and test it, but prevents participants from seeing it and doing it. For “student” researcher accounts you will need to ask your supervisor to activate the study for you. Before you do so, please use the checklist below to ensure that you are not wasting your supervisor’s time. For researcher accounts, check and follow the guidance given in the supervisor cheatsheet on this topic. Once your study is active it cannot be edited without resetting it back to “test” status, essentially deactivating it. Students should confirm that they are completely happy with the study before they ask their supervisor to activate it. This is why the checklist above has been provided. Supervisors have been made aware of this checklist. When a you attempt to edit an active item this warning is displayed at the top of the page next to the “Save” button: If you deactivate your study in this way, even for a minor change, it is your supervisor’s responsibility to reactivate it. You may wish to check that the edits made have not impacted the validity or quality of the project, or how comparable data before and after the changes are. 8.9.1 “Is my study ready?”: Student Checklist Before you ask your supervisor to turn the study status to “active”, please ensure that you have done the following: Checked spelling and grammar across all components and sets and the project. Checked the stimuli presentation is correct and as expected within all components. Tested the order of presentation of components, including debrief/feedback using the test button outlined in the section “Testing Your Study”. Run through your study (multiple times) as if you were a participant. Examined the test run data to ensure that you are getting exactly what you expect and that you can successfully interpret it. Saved a copy of your test data so that you can later exclude it, separating the test data from the real data. Do not ask admins to activate your study. This is something that your supervisor does for you. They must be able to check the validity and quality of the study you have created before they allow you to start collecting data. The process of activating studies is outlined in the supervisor page under the heading “Activating Studies” 8.10 Anonymous Participation To enable anonymous participation, you should take the full project URL that you will be giving to participants, as shown below in the project information page under the text entry box for URL (“exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project?myurl”): You would then place the following suffixes onto the end of it before sending it to participants: &amp;guest: this will take the participant to the project first page with a button to log them in as a guest. &amp;auto: this will automatically log the user in as a guest and display the dialogue box asking for age and gender identity information. &amp;all: will display 3 buttons asking the user to choose between logging in to an existing account, registering for an account and logging in as a guest. Do not put these suffixes into the URL box in the project information. It will not work. This is something you add later to the link that you are sending participants to. So, this means that: “exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&amp;myurl&amp;guest” would display the following button asking the users to press the button to log in as a guest. When they click this button to complete the project, they will receive a dialogue box asking for age and gender identity information. “exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&amp;myurl&amp;auto” will bypass the “login as guest” button, instead they are automatically are logged in as a guest to complete the project and presented with the dialogue box asking for age and gender identity information. “exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&amp;myurl&amp;all” will give the users the following 3 buttons where they can make the choice to login to an existing account, register for an account or login as a guest to complete the project.

["data.html", "Chapter 9 Data 9.1 Data Formats 9.2 Downloading Your Data 9.3 Test Data 9.4 Number of Participants 9.5 Help with Data", " Chapter 9 Data RGuppies Teams needs to be linked in the last section for R support. 9.1 Data Formats Data is downloaded in .CSV files in long format. This means that each line represents a single trial or question. It is important to test each component of your project and generate test data to ensure that the data produced are what you expect and that you know how to interpret it. See the section on testing your project for more information. 9.1.1 Data Outputs Each experiment and questionnaire type has information on how to interpret the data output in the experimental component types and questionnaire types sections. Read the parts appropriate to the types of components and questions that you are using in your study. 9.2 Downloading Your Data 9.2.1 From Individual Components Navigate to each of the components and download the data for each individually. This will download multiple CSV files, one for each component. 9.2.2 From the Entire Project Navigate to the project page and click on the “Exp Data” and “Quest Data” buttons. This will download the data from all the experimental components or questionnaire components respectively in one large CSV file: In some cases, the project CSV files downloaded using the project page can appear to be “missing” some lines of data. This is usually as a result of participants completing multiple studies at the same time. If you experience this, try downloading from individual components. You can combine the CSV files into a single data frame in R when you come to run your analysis if you need to. 9.3 Test Data Before your study goes active you should have performed extensive testing of your study. This will have left test data in your project that you will need to remove from your data from real participant’s data. It is recommended that you download your test data before you ask your supervisor to make your study active. These files will allow you to exclude the test data in R before you conduct your final analysis. 9.4 Number of Participants The sets, supersets and projects display some information on their pages that might give you an impression of the number of participants that you have had run through them, as shown in the tables in the sets and supersets structure. This is an approximation and should not be taken as the definitive number of participants, as there may be issues in your data that might exclude some participants. We have had previous system users misinterpret the meanings of some of the items in this table. Here is what they mean: People: the number of completions of the item shown in that row. The number in brackets shows the number of unique users who has completed it. In this case, exp_178 I have one participant who has completed it 7 times (this was me testing it). Note: “people” includes participants who identify as male, female, non-binary AND anonymous users who have chosen not to disclose their gender identity. Men: this is the number of people who identify as men who have completed the component. Again, unique participants will be shown in brackets. Women: this is the number of people who identify as women who have completed this component. Again, unique participants will be shown in brackets. Median Time: The median time taken for all participants who have run through this component to complete this part. 90th percentile: The 90th percentile time to completion. The button at the top labelled “Guest/Registered Only” allows you to toggle the numbers for those who completed the project as guests/registered and “all”. The totals row is a sum of all of the numbers in each of the columns. As you can see the total for the “people” row shows 18 completions by 5 unique participants, but I have been the only person to complete the study through my testing. The same goes for the men’s and women’s row. The totals do not reflect the true number of participants. Completion stats are only valid for project starting data collection after 24 March 2020, which is when we first started collecting the time that people access the feedback page for a project. These time estimates are for the time from clicking the start button on a project to the final submit button. The numbers do not take into account missing data if people didn’t fill in questionnaires. Sessions previous to this date have an end time equal to the last completed question or experimental trial, even if the user did not complete the entire project. 9.5 Help with Data Aside from issues arising from Experimentum, you should consult your supervisor and the appropriate R Support for assistance in processing and analysing your data. There is a known issue with question names being saved with a /n in the cell. See known issues for an explanation and solution. 9.5.1 Commonly Used Code First completion only If you want to get the first completion of each participant only. Not for use where participants will complete the same study or component repeatedly. Retain only real participant data, removing researcher, student, admin, supervisor and test account data (if these runs are not legitimate data). # load your raw data dat_raw &lt;- read_csv(&quot;experimentum_data.csv&quot;) dat_first_answer &lt;- dat_raw %&gt;% group_by(user_id, q_id) %&gt;% filter(session_id == min(session_id), endtime == min(endtime)) %&gt;% filter(row_number() == 1) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% filter(user_status %in% c(&quot;guest&quot;, &quot;registered&quot;)) "],
["faqs.html", "FAQs Overview About Support About Accounts About Study Construction/Activation About Study Participation About Data", " FAQs Overview The most commonly asked questions, documented here so that you can review the potential solutions. Potential workaround for common bugs awaiting a fix are documented in the Known Issues chapter. About Support I emailed an admin and haven’t received a response In addition to helping you with Experimentum we also have our own research and teaching responsibilities. As a result, our inboxes are usually very full, and emails will inevitably be missed. All students and staff should use the appropriate “Experimentum-web” slack workspace channel if they have support issues as this is the most reliable method of contact. About Accounts I have requested researcher status and haven’t received it Your supervisor is the person responsible for upgrading your account with the appropriate permissions. Admins are not responsible for tracking who is entitled to what access levels. If your supervisor is experiencing technical difficulties in changing your status it is their responsibility to report these issues to the admins, not yours. No third party request on behalf of a supervisor to change access levels will be accepted by admins. Members of teaching staff who are supervising students and experiencing delay in receiving appropriate permissions should contact Professor DeBruine or Rebecca as a matter of urgency via direct message on the appropriate Slack workspace. Researcher status will not be granted to students, researchers or members of the public who do not have an official role at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology. My supervisor approved my researcher status, but my account doesn’t have updated privileges If you are logged in when your supervisor makes these changes you will need to log out and back in again for your privileges to be updated correctly. If this does not resolve the issue contact the admins for support. I have lost my password Automatic password resetting has now been added to the site. See the guidance at Lost Passwords to reset yours. If this is not an option, supervisors and researchers may also issue temporary passwords to their students and participants but should ensure that they take all necessary measures to verify their identity and right to access the account. This could be through the production of student or other photographic ID. If their identity cannot be verified the password should not be reset and instead they should be asked to register for a new account. All temporary passwords should be changed as soon as possible through the Account options on Experimentum. About Study Construction/Activation My questionnaire/responses to questions won’t save Occassionally the Javascript that allows us to save questionnaires stops working. We have yet to determine a pattern or cause for this. Please save your questionnaires frequently to prevent any substantial loss of work (recommended to save every 3 questions added) or to consider using bulk upload of questions. You should save your questionnaires regularly to ensure that if this happens you won’t lose too much work. I recommend saving after every 2-3 questions. Codes assigned to response variables (the number before the colon in the image below) should be unique within that question, otherwise they will overwrite each other, and duplicate options will be removed. Editing options for responses to questions must be closed before you attempt to save the questionnaire by re-clicking the pencil icon next to the cog. You can tell that editing is open by the yellow colour surrounding the response options as below. Can the system make studies which branch depending on the responses given by participants? This is currently an extremely limited option. It is possible to allow participants to self-select to a set by placing multiple supersets within a project rather than one superset as you normally would. Participants will then complete the set that they have selected: We cannot do server-side calculations to filter participants to specific components based upon their responses to questionnaires or experiments. I edited my study and it changed from active to test. How do I change it back? Supervisors are responsible for making sure that your student project is suitably constructed and are the only ones who can authorise you to start collecting data. When you make any change to your study, Experimentum will change the status back to test automatically. Changes must be approved by your supervisor to ensure they have not invalidated your study. When they are satisfied that your study meets the standard that they expect, and that the changes are appropriate, they can change the study back to active for you. You should be aware that changes to your study may render the data collected prior to the changes incomparable with data collected after. Changes should not be made after projects have been set to active unless a) the changes are minimal (for example, correcting a typo) or b) where you are willing to accept the possibility that your data prior to/after the change could potentially be invalidated. It is not the job of the admins to approve changes to your study, as we are not likely to have adequate knowledge of your specialisation to assess it meets the appropriate standard. If your supervisor experiences technical issues in doing this then they must contact admins via the appropriate Slack workspace. My study/components of my study are set to test. How do I make it active? Your supervisor is the person responsible for making this change from test to active when they are satisfied that it meets the standard that they expect. As we do not have expertise in your specialisation, we cannot assess that it meets the appropriate standard. If your supervisor is experiencing technical issues in attempting to do this it is their responsibility to contact the admins, not yours. Where do I put my information/debrief sheet? Your information sheet should usually be entered on the introduction section of the project page. The debrief sheet, likewise, should usually be entered into the feedback section of the top-most set within the project. In certain circumstances it might be put elsewhere, such as when your participants complete different study components. If you do not know where to put your debrief, seek support. Can I have multiple response scales on a single radiopage questionnaire? Unfortunately, this cannot currently be done. Consider making a radio page per scale and combining them into a set. This is most commonly asked in relation to the next question, “Does my Experimentum questionnaire need to look exactly like the paper version?”. Does my Experimentum questionnaire need to look exactly like the paper version? Not always. Paper questionnaires were limited by issues like available printing resources and ease of data input. With electronic delivery this is no longer a concern, and the system can delivery added utility such as question randomisation. If you are concerned that changing the presentation of the instrument you are using has impacted its validity you should discuss these concerns with your supervisors. About Study Participation Can participants skip questions? Yes, on questionnaires participants can skip questions they do not want to answer. If participants choose not to submit data to specific parts they should be informed to continue through the study and leave questions blank. They will then be prompted to ensure that this is their intention: The questions that are incomplete will be highlighted yellow when this prompt is displayed, allowing participants to see what they have left out before they progress. Participants canno skip trials in experimental components. They can discontinue the study by closing their browser. My participants are not being allowed to take part in my study/a part of my study This usually happens when you allow anonymous participation but have chosen to set limitations on gender identity and age range on a component, set or project. Anonymous users ages and genders are not known, thus their eligibility to take part on studies with limitations is not able to be assessed. It used to be that the system would pass the participants directly past the parts of the study with limitations. As a way to combat this, participants of anonymous studies will now see a dialogue box asking for their age and gender identity. If the participants fill in this information and they meet the requirements they will see your study as normal. If they refuse this information they will still bypass the parts of the study with limitations as we cannot tell if they are eligible to participate. If you wish to gather information from participants then you must always respect their right not to answer all of your questions, including their age and gender identity. If this information is refused, then they may not be able to take part in your study. We recommend that if you do not have a strong theoretical or ethical reason to limit participation by these characteristics then you do not place limitations on any part of your study. About Data Missing Data A number of system users have reported “missing data”, however the data was later found to be misattributed to a different project. Truly missing data is rare. Data can be misattributed to a different study if participants are completing more than one study at the same time. Therefore, we recommend that you download your data from each of the individual components from your study rather than downloading the data from the entire project page- see “Downloading Your Data”. All data recorded under the individual components will be contained in the CSV file, regardless of what project it has been attributed to. You should also bear in mind that online studies are particularly prone to attrition, especially if they are longer in duration, repetitive or require high effort levels from participants. If you have concerns about missing data and have tried examining the data from individual components as above without success, contact the admins for support. Where is my data stored? Your data is stored on site at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology. "],
["knownissues.html", "Known Issues, Bugs and Common Errors Overview Common Errors Issues…", " Known Issues, Bugs and Common Errors Overview This is a list of issues that are known and that we are working on to fix. If you discover another issue that is not listed here you can report the issue here- but please check that it has not been reported before you open another issue for it. Common Errors 9.5.2 Data not being saved despite questions being completed. In questionnaire components it has been occassionally reported that, despite completing all of the questions, participant data is not being saved and warnings are presented that not all questions have been filled in. This issue has been traced to the use of HTML tags by users when formatting their questionnaires. If you use HTML tags, you must ensure that you have matching opening and closing tags. Unmatched tags will prevent data from being recorded from this component. Solution: check your HTML formatting, ensure that all opening tags (&lt; &gt;) have matching closing tages (&lt;/ &gt;). 9.5.3 /n in Question Names in Downloaded Data This is a result of a new line being taken when you have entered the name of your questions during the constuction of the study. /n is a reserved combination of characters, representing a new line being taken in a string. As such, this makes it difficult to process this in R. You must “escape” the character in order to use it. Solution: replace the cells in your spreadsheet that contain the /n symbol. Download the example spreadsheet and code for an example of escaping the /n so that you can process your data without hassle. Issues… Which do NOT interfere with the operation of the site These issues are bugs which do not prevent the intended function of the action being carried out at the time of their occurrance and are considered to be of low priority. “The supervisor or supervised could not be found” when changing account type This happens when a supervisor attempts to change the account type of a student from “registered” to “student”. The account changes are carried out regardless of the message. To check this log out, log back in and then check the status of the student. The account being changed must log out and then back in for any changes to take effect, regardless of whether you experience this bug or not. Which DO interfere with the operation of the site These issues are bugs which in some way inhibit the function of the site and are considered high priority for fixes and workarounds. Missing Data A number of system users have reported “missing data”, however the data was later found to be misattributed to a different project. Truly missing data is rare. Data can be misattributed to a different study if participants are completing more than one study at the same time.

You can tell that editing is open by the yellow colour surrounding the response options as below. user_age displayed as “2020.1” There have been some instances where the age in the user_age column of a data set is logged as “2020.1”. This is the age drawn directly from the system. The source of this bug is unknown, as the admins have not been able to directly replicate it. It has only been observed, however, with anonymous participation (guest users). I would suggest that it may be some artifact from the guest user login dialogue box: Workaround: It is recommended that you do not rely on this dialogue box or registered user details for the system to automatically provide participant ages. To prevent data loss, please include a separate age related question in your demographics questionnaire. Video stimuli is not loading Video stimuli which is in excess of 3Mb may not load in good time, or may fail to load completely. Workaround: The site is designed to function with short snippets of video, not long clips. If you cannot compress your files to below 3Mb per stimuli item it is recommended that you host your larger files on other platforms (such as YouTube) and then embed them into a questionnaire component. Email Notifications Email notifications are not always sent. E-mails notifying students and supervisors of changes of account type work seemingly without issue. In particular, e-mails requesting supervisors turn studies to “active” are not being sent. Workaround: Please e-mail your supervisor directly if you require them to review and activate your study. Cannot Share Ownership of Components With Students At the moment it is not possible to share components with students. This stems from a work-around regarding access to and protection of data. Anyone who is an owner of a component may download the data gathered by it, even if that component is also used by others. Workaround: At the moment it is recommended that students create their own components to suit their needs or that the supervisor create any regularly used components, duplicate them and assign the duplicate to the student in need. If you are using questionnaires you may want to consider creating a spreadsheet with the questions, following the templates discussed in the section about adding questions in bulk. 9.5.4 Solved Issues Log of issues that have been resolved. One of (equal) preventing sets from running “One of (equal)” decision rule is no longer available for use in sets and projects. The “one of (equal)” randomisation. There has been a report of this preventing the set from working. On testing no items in the set were run, and no items shown in the “test” sampling of assignment to items in the set. Unless there is a strong theoretical basis for attempting to recruit equal numbers of men and women into each item within a set it is suggested that you use “one of (random)”. If you need to recruit specific number of individuals into each item (where gender identification is not theoretically relevant) we recommend that you monitor the number of completions and work with your supervisor and admins to turn off specific components when the required number is reached.

["supervisor-cheatsheet.html", "Supervisor Cheatsheet Overview Admins Accessing Supervisees Projects, Sets and Components Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Activating Studies Sharing Components Resetting Passwords Autologin Links", " Supervisor Cheatsheet Overview This is a collection of sections from the document directed at the everyday operations that supervisors would need to carry out assembled in one place for easy reference. If there is anything missing please file an issue on the GitHub codebase for this book by clicking here. Many of the operations that can be done with a student account can also be done with a supervisor or researcher account, such as constructing components, sets and projects and testing them. Please see the relevant sections of the manual for these items. Admins Lisa is busy and Rebecca is contracted for 1 hour per week for Experimentum support. Much of the day-to-day of handling your students will fall on you, the supervisor. If you are not prepared to accept this you may need to consider using another system. Admin Responsibilities Our responsibilities are: To try to ensure smooth operation of the site with regards to technical difficulties and instruction of staff and students. We will do this by holding workshops at specific time points throughout the academic year, update this manual and answer questions on Slack. To troubleshoot problematic issues experienced by staff and students. Supervisor Responsibilities To ensure that you have a supervisor account to supervise any of your students who wish to use the site. You may be comfortable allowing some more senior and trustworthy students almost complete autonomy by granting them full researcher status but it is still advisable to have an account of your own. If you wish for them to have full researcher status this must be confirmed by the supervisor to admins directly, not through your student or other third party. If a PhD student takes responsibility for supervising other students they will need to have their own supervisor account. To handle the day-to-day needs of your own students: Ensure that you have the knowledge to know how to implement designs you expect your students to use through the site. To check the standards of your students work. To approve “student” researcher status of your own students. To activate the projects of your own students, even when they deactivate them by making edits after an initial activation. To manage your students expectations of what the site can provide (it will not be perfect or even workable for some types of study). Supervisors should supervise their own students’ accounts only, unless they have the expertise to double-check the veracity of the other staff members students’ work and are prepared to accept the responsibilities outlined above for these students. Admins will not absorb the extra workload for supervisors who refuse to use the system themselves want their students to use it. If you do not want to establish your own account and use it to supervise your students you may wish to consider using a different system. Accessing Supervisees Projects, Sets and Components Once someone is registered as your supervisee you should be access the items that they have created. This allows you to see every project, set and component that they have made. To do this, navigate to the researcher’s section of the website using the panel on the left after login. Next you should pick the option that is most applicable to your needs. If you are trying to access an experimental component, click on the experiments button, for questionnaires the questionnaire button and the same for sets and projects. This will take you to a page where you can see the items of this type that you own by default. To see the items that belong to your supervisees, select their name from the drop-down menu at the top of the page: Select the supervisee in question and then you will be able to see the items of that class that belong to them: You can now access this item by clicking on its name or number. You will be able to inspect, edit and test items. Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure that their students have the status that they require to carry out their projects. This includes assigning them sufficient permissions to construct and deploy their studies. Once the supervisor has “researcher” status they will have a new area of the website opened to them, accessible through the researchers’ link in the menu on the right, which will contain a section called “Admin”: Clicking on this button will take them to a page with more options. To see and make changes to the privileges of those who have requested you as a supervisor and requested researcher status select the option “Supervision” from the menu. Here you will see a list of individuals who have requested you as a supervisor. To change their status, select the appropriate account type from the right-most drop-down menu under the column “Status”. The account you are making changes to will have to log out and back in again to be updated with their new permissions. When you press “Send” an email will be sent to the student to inform them of the status change. If you are a supervising member of teaching or research staff, you should request Lisa Admin or Rebecca Admin as your supervisor. More senior students who are relatively self-sufficient or have their own supervising duties may request “researcher” accounts if you, their supervisor, agrees to it and contacts Rebecca about it directly. No such request will be accepted on the word of a student or request via third party. In such a case where this is agreed they should request Lisa or Rebecca as their supervisor as any other “researcher” account would. Activating Studies 9.5.5 Is this study ready?: Student Checklist Students should use the following checklist before they request their supervisor review and activate their study: Checked spelling and grammar across all components, sets and the project. Checked the stimuli presentation is correct and as expected within all components. Tested the order of presentation of components, including debrief/feedback using the test button outlined in the section “Testing Your Study”. Run through the study (multiple times) as if they were a participant. Examined the test run data to ensure that they are getting exactly what they expect and that they can successfully interpret it. Saved a copy of their test data so that they can later exclude it, separating the test data from the real data. 9.5.6 Making a Study Active Once you activate a study for a “student” researcher account it cannot be edited without resetting it back to “test” status, essentially deactivating it. Students should confirm that they are completely happy with the study before they ask you to activate it. This is why the checklist above has been provided to them. When a student attempts to edit an active item this warning is displayed at the top of the page next to the “Save” button: If a student makes a change to the study after activation, rendering it inactive, you the supervisor remain the point of contact for the student to reactivate it. You may wish to check that the edits made have not impacted the validity or quality of the project, or how comparable data before and after the changes are. To activate the student’s study, follow these steps: Login to your supervisor account. Navigate to the researcher’s section of the site using the menu at the right-hand side of the page: Next, go to the Projects section by using the Projects button on this page: On the Projects page, they will be able to find the names of your supervised students in the drop-down menu. They should select the student’s name: Projects that belong to the student will be displayed here. Click on the project that you want to be turned to active. Under the section that says “Status” it should currently read “test”. To change the entire project (including all sets and components within) select “active” from the drop-down menu and click the button next to it that says “Set all component statuses to project status”: If you do not click “Set all component statuses project status” the project will be activated but not the components within. This means that participants will not complete the components and no data will be gathered for them. Sharing Components In some cases you may wish to share components that you have pre-made with other users, but this can present difficulties. Due to the way that data is attributed to components, if you add an owner to your items, they will be able to see and download all of the data collected by an item that you have added them to. This is obviously not what we want for the purposes of data protection, unless the person you are sharing with is a collaborator on your project and entitled to access this data. What we currently recommend is that, in cases where the person you are sharing with is not authorised to the data collected by your component, is that you duplicate the component using the duplicate button in the component information page: This new duplicate component is essentially a new component, divorced from the data collected by the previous one. You can now add another owner to this by searching for their name in the box, as shown here: Once you have added that person you can then press delete next to your own name should you wish to remove yourself. If you intend to regularly assign the same questionnaires or experiments to level 3 and 4 students for project work, and do not expect them to make their own from scratch each time, it may be an idea to construct your own stock of components and duplicate and share them in this way. Resetting Passwords In instances where registered users have forgotten their password they should normally reset the password themselves using the lost password instructions. In a limited number of cases this will not be an option, for example, if the email inbox of the user in question is not accessible. Researcher status accounts also have permission to reset some passwords, found by searching in the “Participant Data” section in the admin page, but they should limit this to resetting the passwords of their own students or participants. You must be satisfied that the account holder is the person requesting the change of password. In terms of students conducting research projects I would recommend that they present themselves to you in person and/or produce a valid student ID to request a password change as these students have access to participant data. To change a password, you can either: Navigate to Researchers, then Admin and finally to Participants and search for either the entire or partial username or ID number and click “reset password” or Find your student under your supervisory list by going to Researchers, then Admin, then Supervision and selecting their name from the list and selecting “reset password. The new password will be displayed on the page straight away on the page: This password is supposed to be temporary, but it does not expire. It should be changed as soon as possible as it will have likely be communicated via e-mail or will have been written down. Autologin Links Autologin links allow you to by-pass password verification and access the accounts of those that you supervise. These exist to allow admins and supervisors to log in to student’s accounts to examine their studies and help when required. You can access your student’s autologin link by navigating to “Researchers” &gt; “Admin” &gt; “Supervision” and clicking on the student’s name from your list of supervisees: Clicking on the autologin link will log you into the account of this user which allows you to examine what is going on in their account from the perspective of their account. This should be used for troubleshooting issues such as lack of access to the researchers section of the website and bugs that may be specific to their account or project(s). These links are the same ones that the admins use to examine user accounts. Autologin links should be used as the last resort when no other options for troubleshooting are available. These should never be saved anywhere on your computer or made public as this would constitute a serious data protection or security risk. "],
